The American presidency is a central part of our country's identity and is often portrayed in movies, TV shows, and books. People see it as the heart of our nation's power and influence. However, nothing can replace firsthand experience. This guide, based on real experiences from people who worked in the White House, aims to make that knowledge easy to understand and useful for future teams.

To understand the role of the presidency, we should start with the Constitution. The Constitution gives the President “executive power,” makes them the “Commander in Chief,” and requires that they ensure laws are enforced. It also allows the President to get help from top officials in each executive department. Since George Washington's time, each President has had a White House staff and a Cabinet made up of department leaders to support them.

Since the late 1700s, many people have dedicated their time and skills to serving the President and strengthening the nation. Working in the White House Office (WHO) has become an important tradition and is known to be one of the most challenging jobs in government.

The President relies on the team appointed to the WHO because there is too much to manage alone. Delegating tasks is not only helpful; it is essential. The choices that the President's team makes can impact the Administration, its legacy, and the country. The President needs to pick people who will follow the same goals. This decision, made at the start of the Administration, is one of the most important choices a President will make.

### Chief of Staff

The Chief of Staff is an Assistant to the President and is considered first among equals in the staff. This person is the most important staff member for making sure the President's goals are carried out. They manage both the WHO staff and the Executive Office of the President (EOP).

One of the Chief of Staff's first jobs is to create an organizational chart for the WHO, showing clear lines of authority to prevent conflicts. This chart includes points of contact for each area of government outside the White House, including White House Liaisons chosen by the Office of Presidential Personnel (PPO).

The Chief of Staff receives guidance from the President and sets priorities for the WHO. This process begins by looking at the President's campaign promises, identifying possible opportunities, and then assigning policy tasks to the departments, agencies, and the three White House policy councils:

- The National Economic Council (NEC)
- The Domestic Policy Council (DPC)
- The National Security Council (NSC)

The Chief of Staff and senior staff plan the issues that will be discussed each day and week, while making sure that the President is fully informed by the Cabinet and senior team. The Chief of Staff works with policy councils, the Cabinet, the Office of Communications, and the Office of Legislative Affairs (OLA) to implement policies. Senior advisers, the White House Counsel, and other senior staff members are also involved.

The Chief of Staff has to manage time carefully. They need to balance meetings and directions to the WHO with the President's needs. The Chief's use of deputies and influence over the West Wing staff can make the Administration run smoothly, which makes selecting the right person for Chief of Staff crucial.

### Deputy Chiefs of Staff

Presidents usually appoint two Deputy Chiefs of Staff:

1. **Deputy Chief of Staff for Management and Operations**
2. **Deputy Chief of Staff for Policy**

Some Administrations have also appointed deputies to handle other areas like strategy or planning. Sometimes, a principal Deputy Chief is chosen to guide decision-making, structure, and information flow.

### Principal Deputy Chiefs of Staff

Not all Chiefs of Staff have a principal deputy, as this can add complexity. However, when a principal deputy is appointed, their role varies based on the Chief of Staff's needs. Principal deputies often manage specific tasks, address issues they can handle alone, and bring higher-priority items to the Chief of Staff or President. They also manage scheduling and work with policy councils as directed by the Chief of Staff.

- **Deputy Chief of Staff for Management and Operations**: This deputy handles the President's schedule and logistics, such as travel on Air Force One and ground transportation. They coordinate closely with the Secret Service and the military offices that protect the President. This deputy may also work with the NSC, Secretary of Defense, Secretary of State, and Intelligence Community on international travel, and they should be familiar with foreign policy.

- **Deputy Chief of Staff for Policy**: This deputy leads areas like the IGA, OPA, and OPL. For conservative Administrations, they connect the WHO with state and local leaders, political organizations, and grassroots groups. This deputy should have strong policy knowledge in economic, domestic, and social areas.

### Senior Advisers

Senior advisers are often chosen to provide a wide range of advice, including guidance on politics and communication. Senior advisers might also manage specific projects or policy areas, often based on their expertise. Many senior advisers have a close relationship with the President and give input on both policy and communication with the public.

Some Administrations create special offices or councils to support senior advisers, although these can be temporary. Senior advisers need to have enough staff and resources to be effective, and their roles should be clearly defined to ensure they work well with other White House teams.

### Office of White House Counsel

The Office of White House Counsel gives the President and EOP legal advice on issues like presidential powers, ethics, and clemency. Choosing a White House Counsel is an important decision for any President. This office does not make or push policies but makes sure the President's actions follow the law.

Although the White House Counsel is not the President's personal lawyer, the Counsel should have a strong commitment to the President's agenda and to working within legal limits. This office also helps the White House follow legal and ethical guidelines, including financial disclosures, conflict of interest checks, and training.

The White House Counsel's office also works closely with the Department of Justice (DOJ), coordinating important legal matters and keeping the President informed about legal challenges that might affect their agenda.

Attorneys in this office must be able to give quick, reliable legal guidance. The President should choose a Counsel who has broad experience in areas like constitutional law and government processes, as well as a strong loyalty to the President and the Constitution.

### Staff Secretary

The Office of the Staff Secretary is responsible for managing the information that goes in and out of the Oval Office. It acts as a gatekeeper, ensuring the President has all necessary information to make decisions. The Staff Secretary reviews materials like memos, bills, and briefing books and makes sure they are complete and ready for the President.

The Staff Secretary also manages information leaving the Oval Office, directs follow-up questions, and oversees the President's daily briefing book. This office is essential in helping the President stay organized and informed.

### Office of Communications

The Office of Communications, led by the Communications Director, shares the President's agenda with the public through speeches, press briefings, interviews, and social media. The office works closely with the Press Office, speechwriters, and digital teams to maintain a consistent message.

The Communications Director ensures that information aligns with the President's message and that all teams share a unified message. The Press Secretary serves as the President's main spokesperson, delivering messages to the public and responding to media questions.

The Communications Director's job is to make sure the President's message is clear and effective. This role requires political skill and a deep understanding of what is happening in the White House.

### Office of Legislative Affairs (OLA)

The OLA is the link between the White House and Congress, helping to confirm nominees and pass legislation. Since Congress controls federal funding, the OLA works to maintain support in the legislature for the President's agenda.

The OLA works directly with congressional leaders and mediates to build consensus for the President's policies. Internally, OLA staff participate in policy discussions and advise on what Congress is likely to support. Externally, they communicate with Congress to gather votes for the President's priorities.

The OLA team needs to be skilled in both policy and politics, able to communicate effectively about what policies are possible. This office must work as a united team to support the President's agenda.

### Office of Presidential Personnel (PPO)

The phrase “personnel is policy” reflects the importance of the PPO in handling political appointments. Created by President Nixon, the PPO centralizes hiring for political roles, filling around 1,000 Senate-confirmed roles and about 3,000 additional positions.

The PPO recruits and evaluates candidates, conducts background checks, makes recommendations, and ensures a strong relationship with the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) for handling the federal workforce. The PPO is responsible for strategic staffing and developing future leaders.

### Office of Political Affairs (OPA)

The OPA connects the President with political groups, national committees, and campaigns. This office is responsible for understanding the needs of political groups and supporting the President's goals.

Since White House actions often have political impacts, the OPA considers how decisions might affect the President's image. The OPA works closely with other White House offices, the Cabinet, and agencies to make sure all activities align with the Administration's message.

### Office of Cabinet Affairs (OCA)

The OCA coordinates communication between the White House and Cabinet. It organizes Cabinet meetings, assists with communication, and keeps track of the President's agenda to help senior staff. The Cabinet Secretary should have strong organizational skills and experience in politics or law.

### Office of Public Liaison (OPL)

The OPL builds coalitions and supports the President's agenda by working with social, faith-based, minority, and economic groups. The OPL is a large office with a Director who reports to the Chief of Staff. They maintain relationships with senior staff in all departments and hold listening sessions to hear key interest group perspectives.

OPL staff are effective communicators and are skilled in influencing others. Their roles may adjust as the Administration's priorities change.

### Office of Intergovernmental Affairs (IGA)

The IGA connects the White House to state, local, and tribal governments, making sure they understand the President's agenda. The IGA works closely with other White House offices and has staff responsible for specific regions.

The IGA staff need strong communication skills and the ability to work on complex political issues.

### White House Policy Councils

Three policy councils (NSC, NEC, and DPC) help the President manage policy across the executive branch. Each council has three main roles:

- **Policy Coordination.** The councils gather input from various departments to develop policies. They present the President with options if there are major disagreements.

- **Policy Advice.** Council heads act as policy advisers to the President, either as coordinators or as decision-makers.

- **Policy Implementation.** Councils help put policy decisions into action and manage coordination between departments.

Each council may use committees to address issues at different levels, including the Policy Coordinating Committee (PCC), Deputies Committee (DC), and Principals Committee (PC).

The councils work on areas like immigration, health care, energy, and trade. Identifying overlaps and assigning them to one council helps speed up the policy process.

### National Security Council

The National Security Council (NSC) is a legally established interagency group focused on national security. The President, Vice President, and other top officials make up its members. The NSC provides advice on foreign policy and national security and ensures information is shared in times of crisis.

### National Economic Council

The National Economic Council (NEC) was created to oversee the President's economic agenda. The NEC has four main tasks: to coordinate economic policy, advise the President, make sure policies match the President's goals, and monitor progress.

The NEC Director works with Cabinet members and agencies on economic goals, covering areas like infrastructure, small business, housing, and financial regulation.

### Domestic Policy Council

The Domestic Policy Council (DPC) advises the President on domestic issues, such as health care, housing, and immigration. The DPC includes experts who help develop and coordinate policies. The council's work supports the Administration's main priorities.

The DPC works closely with other offices to encourage economic opportunity and innovation. It also collaborates with the NSC on border security.

### Office of the Vice President (OVP)

The Vice President acts as a close adviser to the President and helps put the Administration's goals into place. Many Presidents give the VP an office in the West Wing, where they are involved in key decisions.

The VP can lead important projects, break tie votes in the Senate, and serve as a representative of the Administration in meetings with foreign leaders.

### Office of the First Lady/First Gentleman

The First Lady or First Gentleman supports the President's agenda, often focusing on specific social issues. Since the First Spouse is not an elected official, they can address sensitive topics with less political risk.

The First Spouse usually has a Chief of Staff and a team in the East Wing. Past initiatives have focused on topics like bullying, drug abuse, and fitness.
