## PRIMARY RECOMMENDATION

Our primary recommendation is that the President pursue legislation to dismantle the Department of Homeland Security (DHS). After 20 years, it has not gelled into “One DHS.” Instead, its various components' different missions have outweighed its decades-long attempt to function as one department, rendering the whole disjointed rather than cohesive. Breaking up the department along its mission lines would facilitate mission focus and provide opportunities to reduce overhead and achieve more limited government. In lieu of a status quo DHS, we recommend that:

- U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) be combined with Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE); U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS); the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) Office of Refugee Resettlement (ORR); and the Department of Justice (DOJ) Executive Office for Immigration Review (EOIR) and Office of Immigration Litigation (OIL) into a standalone border and immigration agency at the Cabinet level (more than 100,000 employees, making it the third largest department measured by manpower).
- The Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) be moved to the Department of Transportation.
- The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) be moved to the Department of the Interior or, if combined with CISA, to the Department of Transportation.
- The U.S. Coast Guard (USCG) be moved to DOJ and, in time of full-scale war (i.e., threatening the homeland), to the Department of Defense (DOD). Alternatively, USCG should be moved to DOD for all purposes.
- The U.S. Secret Service (USSS) be divided in two, with the protective element moved to DOJ and the financial enforcement element moved to the Department of the Treasury.
- The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) be privatized.
- The Science and Technology Directorate (S&T) be moved to DOD and the Office of Countering Weapons of Mass Destruction be moved to the FBI.

All of the remaining supporting components could be dismantled because their functions already exist in the moving components as well as the receiving departments. Cutting these costs would save the American taxpayers significant sums.

Unless and until this dismantling recommendation is pursued and achieved, however, DHS will statutorily continue to exist, and it needs many reforms. Accordingly, we now turn to recommended changes in DHS as it exists now.

## MISSION STATEMENT

The Department of Homeland Security protects the American homeland from and prepares for terrorism and other hazards in both the physical and cyber realms, provides for secure and free movement of trade and travel, and enforces U.S. immigration laws impartially.

## OVERVIEW

The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) was created in the aftermath of the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, and subsequent mailings of anthrax spores. The Homeland Security Act of 2002, which created the department, states that DHS's primary mission is to prevent terrorist attacks within the U.S.; reduce the nation's vulnerability to terrorism; minimize the damage from and assist in the recovery from any terrorist attacks; prepare and respond to natural and manmade crises and emergencies; and monitor connections between illegal drug trafficking and terrorism, coordinate efforts to sever such connections, and interdict illegal drug trafficking.

Unfortunately for our nation, the federal government's newest department became like every other federal agency: bloated, bureaucratic, and expensive. It also lost sight of its mission priorities. DHS has also suffered from the Left's wokeness and weaponization against Americans whom the Left perceives as its political opponents.

To truly secure the homeland, a conservative Administration needs to return the department to the right mission, the right size, and the right budget. This would include reorganizing the department and shifting significant resources away from several supporting components to the essential operational components. Prioritizing border security and immigration enforcement, including detention and deportation, is critical if we are to regain control of the border, repair the historic damage done by the Biden Administration, return to a lawful and orderly immigration system, and protect the homeland from terrorism and public safety threats. This also includes consolidating the pieces of the fragmented immigration system into one agency to fulfill the mission more efficiently.

The Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) is a DHS component that the Left has weaponized to censor speech and affect elections at the expense of securing the cyber domain and critical infrastructure, which are threatened daily. A conservative Administration should return CISA to its statutory and important but narrow mission.

The bloated DHS bureaucracy and budget, along with the wrong priorities, provide real opportunities for a conservative Administration to cut billions in spending and limit government's role in Americans' lives. These opportunities include privatizing TSA screening and the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) National Flood Insurance Program, reforming FEMA emergency spending to shift the majority of preparedness and response costs to states and localities instead of the federal government, eliminating most of DHS's grant programs, and removing all unions in the department for national security purposes.

A successful DHS would:
- Secure and control the border;
- Thoroughly enforce immigration laws;
- Correctly and efficiently adjudicate immigration benefit applications while rejecting fraudulent claims;
- Secure the cyber domain and collaborate with critical infrastructure sectors to maintain their security;
- Provide states and localities with a limited federal emergency response and preparedness;
- Secure our coasts and economic zones;
- Protect political leaders, their families, and visiting heads of state or government; and
- Oversee transportation security.

## OFFICE OF THE SECRETARY (SEC)

In the next Administration, the Office of the Secretary should take on the following key issues and challenges to ensure the effective operation of DHS.

### Expansion of Dedicated Political Personnel
The Secretary of Homeland Security is a presidentially appointed and Senate-confirmed political appointee, but for budgetary reasons, he or she has historically been unable to fund a dedicated team of political appointees. A key first step for the Secretary to improve front-office functions is to have his or her own dedicated team of political appointees selected and vetted by the Office of Presidential Personnel, which is not reliant on detailees from other parts of the department, to help ensure the completion of the next President's agenda.

### An Aggressive Approach to Senate-Confirmed Leadership Positions
While Senate confirmation is a constitutionally necessary requirement for appointing agency leadership, the next Administration may need to take a novel approach to the confirmations process to ensure an adequate and rapid transition. For example, the next Administration arguably should place its nominees for key positions into similar positions as “actings” (for example, putting in a person to serve as the Senior Official Performing the Duties of the Commissioner of CBP while that person is going through the confirmation process to direct ICE or become the Secretary). This approach would both guarantee implementation of the Day One agenda and equip the department for potential emergency situations while still honoring the confirmation requirement. The department should also look to remove lower-level but nevertheless important positions that currently require Senate confirmation from the confirmation requirement, although this effort would require legislation (and might also be mooted in the event of legislation that closes portions of the department that currently have Senate-confirmed leadership).

### Clearer, More Durable, and Political-Only Line of Succession
Based on previous experience, the department needs legislation to establish a more durable but politically oriented line of succession for agency decision-making purposes. The ideal sequence for line of succession is certainly debatable, except that in circumstances where a career employee holds a leadership position in the department, that position should be deemed vacant for line-of-succession purposes and the next eligible political appointee in the sequence should assume acting authority. Further, individuals wielding acting Secretary authority should have explicit authority to finalize agency actions, including regulations, to ensure that the department's homeland security mission is fulfilled.

### Soft Closure of Unnecessary Offices
Pending a possible presidential decision to shrink or eliminate DHS itself, the next Administration will still have the obligation to protect the homeland as required by law. The Secretary therefore can and should use his or her inherent, discretionary leadership authority to “soft close” ineffective and problematic corners of the department. While those corners are to be determined, the Secretary could shift personnel, funding, and operational responsibility to mission-essential components of the department, including the Office of the Secretary itself. This effort not only would make the department more efficient, but also would support a legislative move to shrink or dismantle the department by showing that the agency can fulfill national security–critical functions without its current bloated bureaucracy.

### Restructuring and Redistribution of Career Personnel
To strengthen political decision-making and ensure that taxpayer dollars are being used legally and efficiently, the Secretary should make major changes in the distribution of career personnel throughout the department. For example, personnel from parts of the department undergoing soft closure could be redistributed to what will be workload-intensive corners of the department, including national security–critical and transparency functions. All personnel with law enforcement capacity should be removed immediately from office billets and deployed to field billets to maximize law enforcement capacity.

### Compliance for Grants and Other Federal Funding
The next Administration should take steps to restore lawfulness and integrity to the department's massive regimen of federal grant programs, most of which are managed and distributed by the Federal Emergency Management Agency. The Secretary should direct FEMA to ensure that all FEMA-issued grant funding for states, localities, and private organizations is going to recipients who are lawful actors, can demonstrate that they are in compliance with federal law, and can show that their mission and actions support the broader homeland security mission. All applicants and potential recipients of such grant funding should be required to meet certain preconditions for eligibility (except for receipt of post-disaster or nonhumanitarian funding) or should simply be considered ineligible for funding. Such preconditions should include at least the following:

- Certification by applicants that they comply with all aspects of federal immigration laws, including the honoring of all immigration detainers.
- Certification by applicants that they are both registered with E-Verify and using E-Verify in a transparent and nonevasive manner. For states and localities, that would include certification that all components of that government, and not just the applicant agency, are registered with and use E-Verify.
- If the applicant is a state or locality, commitment by that state or locality to total information-sharing in the context of both federal law enforcement and immigration enforcement. This would include access to department of motor vehicles and voter registration databases.

### Non-Use of Discretionary Guest Worker Visa Authorities
To stop facilitating the availability of cheap foreign labor in order to support American workers (particularly poor and middle-class American workers) and follow congressional intent, the Secretary should explicitly cease using at least two discretionary authorities as part of his or her broader effort to support American workers.

- The Secretary should make it clear that he or she will not use the Secretary's existing discretionary authority to increase the number of H-2B (seasonal non-agricultural) visas above the statutorily set cap.
- The Secretary should not issue any regulations in support of the “H-2 eligible” country list, the effect of which would prevent favoring certain foreign nationals seeking an H-2 guest worker visa based simply on their nationality.

### Restoration of Honesty and Transparency
The Secretary should use his or her inherent authority as leader of the department to follow up with congressional and other partners to disclose information and provide the transparency that has been obstructed during the Biden Administration. The Secretary should proceed from the assumption that congressional inquiries and public information requests were unfulfilled and then seek to fulfill them.

### Replacement of the Entire Homeland Security Advisory Committee
The Secretary should plan to quickly remove all current members of the Homeland Security Advisory Committee and replace them as quickly as is feasible.

## U.S. CUSTOMS AND BORDER PROTECTION (CBP)

If all immigration agencies are not merged, including USCIS and ORR, then an appropriate third alternative would be to consolidate ICE and CBP to form a combined Border Security and Immigration Agency (BSIA). This would integrate critical interdiction, enforcement, and investigative resources, enhancing coordination and refocusing collective efforts on the vast and complex cross-border threats impacting our nation's health, safety, and national security. It would also simultaneously add efficiencies to our nation's capacity to facilitate lawful trade and travel.

The BSIA should establish clear mission requirements, responsibilities, and mandates under existing law regarding the persistent need for and utilization of U.S. military personnel and resources to assist BSIA with increasing whole-of-government efforts and long-term strategy to secure our nation's borders effectively. In addition, appropriate elements within the newly created BSIA should be designated as part of the U.S. National Security and Intelligence Community.

A conservative Administration should eliminate any prohibitive guidance, direction, or mandate from DHS or the Administration that curtails or limits CBP from publishing detailed border security and enforcement data not impacting intelligence, interdiction, and investigative operations, methods, or sources. DHS should issue a regulation mandating that CBP publish accurate and timely border security data, readily available to the public, on a regular basis that avoids White House and DHS leadership review and approval.

The White House should grant the authority for CBP and DHS executives to utilize component aviation assets under the Office of Air and Marine (OAM). CBP and DHS have worldwide missions with personnel and facilities that are deployed across the globe and in every state in the U.S. With a CBP workforce alone of more than 60,000 people (240,000-plus for DHS) encompassing more than a thousand sea, land, and airports, it is essential that the Commissioner, Deputy Commissioner, Secretary, and Deputy Secretary can travel efficiently to facilities to maintain appropriate situational awareness across the department's vast mission set and interact with the expansive workforce. Although CBP operates one of the largest aviation components of any domestic U.S. law enforcement agency, executives are prohibited from utilizing the agency's aviation assets to facilitate official travel. Executives are required to fly on commercial airlines, and this requirement significantly limits their ability to have classified communications and takes them offline for extended periods of time.

Border Patrol (BP) and OAM should be combined within CBP. BP has more than 20,000 personnel, and OAM has approximately 1,800. OAM's assets are dedicated in support of BP operations the vast majority of the time, yet redundant approvals, strategies, and independent hierarchal commands serve as impediments to efficient and practical resource deployments.

CBP should restart and expand use of the horseback-mounted Border Patrol. As part of this announcement, the Secretary should clear the records and personnel files of those who were falsely accused by Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas of whipping migrants and issue a formal apology on behalf of DHS and CBP.

The Secretary should combine the Office of Trade (OT) and Trade Relations with the Office of Field Operations (OFO). The OT is the smallest of CBP's components, and its operational counterpart, OFO, has a workforce of more than 30,000. OT's function is interwoven with that of its OFO operational counterpart. Combining OT with OFO would achieve streamlined operations and increase OT's capacity and capability by leveraging OFO's expansive resources.

CBP, ICE, and USCIS all have authority to issue Notices to Appear (NTA) to removable aliens in their presence, which begins removal proceedings. In most instances, CBP should turn illegal aliens over to ICE for detention, and ICE can then issue any needed NTA. CBP should issue NTAs only in limited situations for humanitarian reasons, such as medical emergencies. In addition, CBP should eliminate use of Notices to Report (NTR) altogether.

CBP's established national standards of Transport, Escort, Detention, and Search (TEDS) have been widely interpreted and expanded by lower courts. This has resulted in unrealistic and differing detention standards for CBP facilities based on the jurisdiction within which they fall, negatively impacting operations. ICE has suffered similarly. A single nationwide detention standard should be codified that prevents individual states from mandating that federal government agencies adhere to widely expansive and ever-changing sets of standards. Such standards should allow the flexibility to use large numbers of temporary facilities such as tents.

The annual costs associated with establishing and maintaining temporary facilities to address the flow of illegal migration and associated care, transportation, and processing are prohibitive, and CBP's budget is inadequate. CBP is forced to forgo critical mission-essential endeavors to fund the additional associated costs. Often, this requires the reprogramming of funding at the DHS level, which has a negative impact on other DHS components' operations. This predictable cost that has to be paid from existing CBP and DHS funding levels reduces CBP's operational readiness and ability to accomplish its diverse and critical missions to protect the American people. The next President should request a realistic budget that fully pays for these costs.

Increased funding is needed for BP to hire additional support personnel, which would relieve uniformed BP agents from administrative duties associated with processing aliens and allow them to return to their national security mission. Congress should increase funding for facility upgrades at strategic land Ports of Entry (POEs), including expanding state-of-the-art technology such as Non-Intrusive Inspection equipment. Today, the cartels exploit the aging facilities and lack of adequate technology to smuggle illicit drugs, contraband, and more successfully through our nation's POEs.

## U.S. IMMIGRATION AND CUSTOMS ENFORCEMENT (ICE)

### Needed Reforms

Since the formation of DHS, ICE has increasingly been tasked with auxiliary missions that have little or nothing to do with either immigration or customs enforcement. To return ICE to its primary mission, any new Administration that wishes to restore the rule of law to our immigration enforcement efforts should:

- **Order ICE to stop closing out pending immigration cases** and apply the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) as written by Congress. The Biden Administration closed out tens of thousands of immigration cases that had already been prepared and were slated for expedited removal processing or hearings before the U.S. Immigration Court. This misguided action constituted an egregious example of lawlessness that allowed thousands of illegal aliens and other immigration violators to go free in the United States.
  
- **Direct ICE to stop ignoring criminal aliens identified through the 287(g) program.** Ultimately, Congress should prevent ICE from ignoring criminal aliens identified by local law enforcement agencies that are partners in the 287(g) program. However, before congressional action, ICE should be directed to take custody of all aliens with records for felonies, crimes of violence, DUIs, previous removals, and any other crime that is considered a national security or public safety threat as defined under current laws.

- **Eliminate T and U visas.** Victimization should not be a basis for an immigration benefit. If an alien who was a trafficking or crime victim is actively and significantly cooperating with law enforcement as a witness, the S visa is already available and should be used. Pending elimination of the T and U visas, the Secretary should significantly restrict eligibility for each visa to prevent fraud.

- **Issue clear guidance regarding detention and bond for aliens.** Thousands of illegal aliens are allowed to bond out of immigration detention only to disappear into the interior of the United States where many commit crimes and many others disappear, never to be heard from again. This occurs primarily because of poorly worded bond regulations, contradictory bond policy memoranda, and poor practices for managing released aliens and the Alternatives to Detention (ATD) Program, which requires significant reform.

- **Prioritize national security in the Student and Exchange Visitor Program (SEVP).** ICE should end its current cozy deference to educational institutions and remove security risks from the program. This requires working with the Department of State to eliminate or significantly reduce the number of visas issued to foreign students from enemy nations.

Most of the foregoing can be accomplished rapidly and effectively through executive action that is both lawful and appropriate. Additionally, ICE should clarify who is responsible for enforcing its criminal and civil authorities. It should also remove self-imposed limitations on its nationwide jurisdiction.

- **Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) Special Agents in the 1811 series** should enforce Title 8 and 18 crimes as the biggest part of their portfolio. Alien smuggling, trafficking, and cross-border crime as defined under Title 8 and Title 18 should be the focus of ICE operations.

- **Clarify the role of ICE Deportation Officers.** ICE Enforcement and Removal Operations (ERO) should be identified as being primarily responsible for enforcing civil immigration regulations, including the civil arrest, detention, and removal of immigration violators anywhere in the United States, without warrant where appropriate, subject only to the civil warrant requirements of the INA where appropriate.

- **Rescind all ICE memoranda identifying “sensitive zones”** where ICE personnel are prohibited from operating. Rely on the good judgment of officers in the field to avoid inappropriate situations.

- **Make full use of existing Expedited Removal (ER) authorities.** The agency has limited the use of ER to eligible aliens apprehended within 100 miles of the border. This is not a statutory requirement.

### New Policies

U.S. national security and public safety interests would be well-served if ICE were to be combined with CBP and USCIS, as mentioned above. Additionally, ICE/HSI, along with CBP, should be full participants in the Intelligence Community.

- **Operationalize the use of Blackie's Warrants within ICE.** These civil search warrants are commonly used for worksite enforcement when agents have probable cause that illegal aliens are employed at a business. This would streamline investigations.

- **Ensure continuous vetting and investigations of many aliens who exploited President Biden's open border** for potentially nefarious purposes, including some Afghan evacuees sent directly to the U.S. during America's disastrous withdrawal from Afghanistan.

### Budget

- **Mandate and fund additional bed space for alien detainees.** Congress should increase ICE's detention space to allow for 100,000 available beds daily.

- **Fund additional personnel.** Congress should support ICE by increasing the budget for at least 20,000 ERO officers and 5,000 Office of the Principal Legal Advisor (OPLA) attorneys.

## U.S. CITIZENSHIP AND IMMIGRATION SERVICES (USCIS)

USCIS is tasked with administering legal immigration and certain temporary visa programs.

### Needed Reforms

Since January 2021, USCIS has transformed into an open-borders agency, ignoring its critical role in national security and public safety. To return USCIS to its primary function as a screening and vetting agency, a conservative Administration should:

- **Refocus on screening and vetting.** Regulatory efforts have focused on easing asylum eligibility in a manner that exacerbates fraud. Misaligned priorities have placed emphasis on expanding parole and temporary status programs that violate the law and congressional intent.

- **Reform the Fraud Detection and National Security Directorate (FDNS).** FDNS should undergo a structural shift focused on direct reporting from the field to headquarters, reclassification of leadership, and prioritization of vetting and fraud detection over other agency directives.

- **Reestablish the denaturalization unit** within USCIS, in cooperation with the Department of Justice, to pursue denaturalization cases involving aliens who obtained citizenship through fraud.

- **Create a criminal enforcement component within USCIS** to investigate immigration benefits fraud under Title 8 and prosecute cases via Special Assistant U.S. Attorneys with expertise in this area.

- **Audit and rescind** all Biden Administration policies, memoranda, and management directives to revert USCIS to its original mission.

### New Policies

To address broader immigration issues, the core immigration agencies—USCIS, ICE, and CBP—should merge, including the Office of Refugee Resettlement (ORR) from HHS, to form a single, cohesive entity. Short of this merger, USCIS should:

- **Realign workforce training on base eligibility and fraud detection.**

- **Resume adjudicator training at the Federal Law Enforcement Training Centers (FLETC)** to emphasize the enforcement and vetting role of USCIS.

- **Adopt a conservative regulatory agenda.** USCIS should pursue rulemaking for the Trump Administration's public charge rule, employment authorization reform, asylum reform, and U visa reform.

- **Shift away from internal policy mechanisms that allow lenient adjudication standards.** USCIS should also rescind COVID-era procedural flexibilities, such as biometrics reuse.

### Budget

USCIS is primarily funded through application fees paid by those seeking immigration benefits, work permits, and naturalization, with a small portion coming from congressional appropriations.

- **Increase application fees to reflect inflation and true adjudication costs.** USCIS should submit a fee rule that raises fees across the board to keep up with inflation. This increase should also limit fee waivers and implement a fee for asylum applications.

- **Expand premium processing options.** Offering more premium processing options would allow applicants to expedite their processing times, which could generate a significant influx of revenue for USCIS.

- **Implement strict financial penalties for rejected applicants.** Until USCIS clears its backlog, applicants rejected for any benefit should be required to leave the United States immediately, and USCIS should pause intake of applications in backlogged categories.

### Personnel

USCIS should be classified as a national security–sensitive agency, with all employees in national security–sensitive roles.

- **Investigate and discipline leaks as in a national security agency.** USCIS should remove personnel who cannot adhere to security standards and, if necessary, decertify the USCIS employee union.

- **Decentralize personnel out of Washington, D.C., and reassign them to field offices.** Rotating USCIS staff into communities most impacted by immigration decisions would improve agency accountability and connect staff directly to affected communities.

## NECESSARY BORDER AND IMMIGRATION STATUTORY, REGULATORY, AND ADMINISTRATIVE CHANGES

To address current border security challenges, Congress must pass legislation to close existing loopholes and ensure the continuity of U.S. immigration control.

### Legislative Proposals

- **Create a Title 8-based public health authority** akin to Title 42 for immediate expulsion of illegal border crossers under specific non-health conditions.

- **Mandate appropriations for border wall system infrastructure** in accordance with the Border Security Improvement Plan (BSIP) for strategic locations.

- **Repeal or amend the William Wilberforce Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act of 2008** to allow the expedited return of unaccompanied minors to their home countries.

- **End the Flores Settlement Agreement** by establishing nationwide standards for family and unaccompanied minor detention, allowing for the use of temporary facilities where needed.

- **Reform asylum eligibility requirements.** Raise the credible fear standard to align with the asylum standard and codify asylum bars for gang and domestic violence cases as grounds for ineligibility.

- **End abuse of parole authority.** Congress should clarify and limit the use of parole to extraordinary and limited purposes, aligning it with the original statutory intent.

- **Eliminate funding for NGOs involved in processing or transporting illegal aliens.** Instead, redirect these funds to support border security, detention facilities, and spaces for immigration court proceedings.

- **Expand Migrant Protection Protocols** (Remain in Mexico) and **Asylum Cooperative Agreements** to ensure that asylum seekers can be processed outside of the U.S., where feasible.

- **Limit employment authorization** to legal immigrants and certain non-immigrants by enacting stricter controls over work permits. Also, **mandate E-Verify** to ensure employment eligibility verification.

- **Empower state and local law enforcement** to participate in immigration enforcement consistent with Arizona v. United States. Congress should also require compliance with federal immigration detainers and establish financial disincentives for sanctuary policies.

- **Mandate detention of illegal border crossers** by clarifying that Title 8 requires detention, not discretionary release, ensuring stronger enforcement of immigration laws.

### Regulatory Changes

- **Withdraw Biden Administration regulations** on credible fear and asylum jurisdiction for border crossers and public charge standards, replacing them with rules that prioritize national security and prevent fraud.

- **Reform T and U visa eligibility requirements** to ensure these visas are granted only to legitimate trafficking and crime victims who provide substantial assistance to law enforcement.

- **Eliminate Temporary Protected Status (TPS) designations** and transition to a stricter employment-based immigration system.

- **Revamp the H-1B program** to prioritize high-skilled workers at competitive wages, minimizing any displacement of U.S. workers.

### Executive Orders

- **Restore the Asylum Cooperative Agreements and Remain in Mexico Protocols** by directing the Department of State and DHS to renegotiate and reimplement these policies immediately.

- **Restrict the use of Notices to Report and government-sponsored transportation** for illegal aliens, instead mandating detention or supervised processing.

- **Curtail discretionary parole** and limit its use to cases certified by DHS as meeting strict humanitarian or public benefit criteria.

- **Mandate E-Verify use for federal contractors** and employees working with government agencies to ensure employment eligibility verification.

- **Ensure comprehensive access to national security databases** for USCIS by designating it as Intelligence Community-adjacent, facilitating better information-sharing for immigration-related national security screening.

### Subregulatory Measures

- **Prioritize fraud detection and eligibility verification** by realigning USCIS Fraud Detection and National Security (FDNS) operations and increasing transparency.

- **Reinstate ICE worksite enforcement initiatives** using Blackie's Warrants to address employment of illegal aliens in industries susceptible to exploitation.

- **Mandate cooperation for 287(g) program participants** and refocus Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) on immigration-related criminal activities.

### FEDERAL EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT AGENCY (FEMA)

#### Needed Reforms

FEMA's expanded role has led it to compensate for gaps in state and local preparedness, often at great cost. Reform should prioritize true federalism by reducing FEMA's burden and redirecting resources to genuinely catastrophic disasters. Key reforms include:

- **Adjust the per capita indicator for damages** under the Stafford Act, making it inflation-adjusted to ensure states and localities contribute to their own recovery costs, reserving FEMA's resources for major events.

- **Implement a deductible system** that would require states to meet certain cost thresholds before becoming eligible for FEMA assistance. This would encourage state-level preparedness and responsible budgeting for disaster resilience.

- **Reform cost-sharing ratios** so that the federal government only covers a higher percentage for the most catastrophic events, shifting more responsibility to states for smaller-scale disasters.

- **Wind down the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP).** FEMA should begin phasing out NFIP in favor of a privately managed system, starting with low-risk areas. This would reduce reliance on federal subsidies and encourage private sector risk management in flood-prone zones.

#### Budget Considerations

FEMA's grant programs, originally intended to bolster state and local preparedness, have often devolved into pork-barrel spending that does not measurably enhance national resilience. To refocus these funds:

- **Eliminate or significantly reduce non-disaster grant programs** that lack clear ties to genuine preparedness improvements. Redirect funds to support disaster response, relief, and infrastructure resilience.

- **Decrease FEMA's reliance on debt financing** by promoting state preparedness, budget restructuring, and realigning funding priorities.

#### Personnel and Structure

- **Reduce Senate-confirmed positions** to streamline FEMA's leadership, retaining only the Administrator as a confirmed role to allow rapid response and decision-making.

- **Reposition FEMA's "springing Cabinet position."** This change would prevent operational disruptions by reducing turnover and ensuring steady leadership during crises.

### CYBERSECURITY AND INFRASTRUCTURE SECURITY AGENCY (CISA)

#### Needed Reforms

CISA's role has expanded beyond its core missions of protecting federal networks and coordinating critical infrastructure security. To realign CISA with its statutory mandate:

- **End all counter-disinformation programs.** CISA should cease involvement in content moderation or censorship activities, which fall outside its original mission scope.

- **Narrow CISA's mission** to focus solely on federal network security (.gov) and critical infrastructure resilience. Transfer emergency communications and Chemical Facility Anti-Terrorism Standards (CFATS) to FEMA.

- **Limit election security responsibilities** to cyber hygiene assistance for states and localities, avoiding involvement in messaging or influencing election processes.

- **Disband the CISA Cybersecurity Advisory Committee** and refocus CISA's resources on direct cyber threat mitigation and infrastructure protection.

### U.S. COAST GUARD (USCG)

#### Mission and Budget Realignment

USCG should concentrate on defending U.S. waters and economic zones, while supporting the Navy in wartime as needed:

- **Scale down USCG's mission to focus on U.S. home waters.** Allocate resources to patrol the Pacific to counter growing foreign fishing and security threats, especially from China, while maintaining anti-smuggling operations in the Caribbean.

- **Update fleet acquisition plans.** Submit a long-term shipbuilding plan to Congress that aligns with U.S. strategic goals and budget realities. Coordinate with the Navy on shipyard utilization to ensure timely and budget-conscious fleet development.

- **Prioritize Arctic responsibilities based on funding.** USCG should only maintain Arctic operations if funding levels support it; otherwise, consider transferring Arctic duties to the Navy.

#### Personnel Considerations

- **Revise recruitment and retention messaging** to attract a high-caliber workforce. Emphasize mission-critical skills rather than politically charged narratives.

- **Reinstate personnel who left over COVID-19 vaccine requirements,** with credited time in service. Review promotions and hirings under the previous administration to ensure merit-based advancement.

### U.S. SECRET SERVICE (USSS)

#### Needed Reforms

USSS must focus exclusively on its protective mission, shedding non-essential investigative duties to bolster its core functions:

- **Separate investigative and protective missions.** Transfer financial crime investigations to the Departments of Justice and Treasury, allowing USSS to concentrate solely on physical protection.

- **Close or transfer non-Washington, D.C., field offices.** Agents stationed outside of Washington, D.C., should be reassigned to Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) offices for assistance with local protection duties.

- **Retain only immigration-related financial investigations.** USSS may investigate crimes tied to illegal immigration financing, such as remittances, payments to smugglers, and other illegal financial activities.

- **Implement a visitor log policy for all presidential facilities.** This would improve transparency and accountability, especially for frequent trips outside the White House.

#### Budget and Personnel Adjustments

- **Reallocate budget savings from office closures to protection initiatives.** With fewer offices, funds can be directed towards enhancing protective training, resources, and recruitment.

- **Enhance Uniformed Division staffing and responsibilities.** Increase personnel to manage high turnover and assign full law enforcement powers within Washington, D.C., broadening their jurisdiction for experience and morale.

### TRANSPORTATION SECURITY ADMINISTRATION (TSA)

#### Pathway to Privatization

The current TSA model is inefficient and should be replaced with a privatized model, emulating European and Canadian security operations:

- **Expand the Screening Partnership Program (SPP)** to enable airports to manage security operations through private contractors, with TSA setting standards and overseeing compliance.

- **Adopt a Canadian model** by creating a government corporation to contract private screening services, with regional bidding to drive down costs.

- **Deunionize TSA's workforce** to streamline operations, enhance security flexibility, and improve morale.

#### Potential Cost Savings and Benefits

- **Achieve a 15–20% cost reduction** compared to current TSA operating budgets. Privatization could lead to more responsive, traveler-oriented service, coupled with lower taxpayer costs.

### MANAGEMENT DIRECTORATE (MGMT)

#### Streamlining Operations and Reducing Bureaucracy

The Management Directorate should undergo extensive reforms to eliminate redundancy and improve efficiency:

- **Assign a small advisory team** in the Front Office (FO) with expertise in operational management, U.S. government employment law, and restructuring to guide and assess necessary structural changes.

- **Revise senior leadership reporting structures.** The Senior Executive Service (SES) should revert to their original role as managers adaptable to any subject matter, ensuring skilled management at every level.

- **Analyze and revise Management Directives** to remove red tape in hiring, IT, procurement, and budgeting. Specifically, streamline the Office of the Chief Human Capital Officer's hiring process and reduce procurement bottlenecks for innovative technology.

#### Financial Oversight and Legislative Affairs

- **Integrate appropriations staff with Legislative Affairs (OLA)** for unified, consistent messaging and accountability to Congress, avoiding discrepancies and "answer shopping" by congressional staff.

- **Centralize budget communications to avoid inconsistencies.** The Chief Financial Officer (CFO) should coordinate with OLA before submitting budgetary responses to Congress.

- **Reposition the Federal Protective Service (FPS)** under direct Secretary oversight, especially in times of civil unrest, to ensure law enforcement expertise and authority during crises.

---

### OFFICE OF STRATEGY, POLICY, AND PLANS (PLCY)

#### Key Department-Level Reforms

The Office of Strategy, Policy, and Plans should lead the charge in aligning the Department of Homeland Security's (DHS) priorities with presidential objectives while respecting Americans' rights:

- **Inventory and re-evaluate domestic terrorism initiatives** to ensure consistency with the administration's goals and constitutional rights.

- **Publish and analyze DHS's past activities related to social media censorship** and disengage any personnel involved in such efforts. Transparency will restore trust and focus on mission-oriented tasks.

- **Centralize the DHS grant policy.** All granting decisions across components should follow department-wide guidelines, vetted for alignment with the President's priorities, to ensure consistency and effective use of funds.

#### Streamlining and Reducing Bureaucracy

- **Consolidate redundant reporting requirements.** PLCY should work with Congress to reduce overlapping and outdated reporting obligations. Consider eliminating the Quadrennial Homeland Security Review for improved focus on mission-critical tasks.

#### Enhancing Immigration Data and Transparency

- **Develop a centralized Immigration Statistics program** to produce timely, reliable data across all immigration-related components, enabling DHS to better monitor and inform on immigration trends.

### OFFICE OF INTELLIGENCE AND ANALYSIS (I&A)

#### Proposal for Elimination

The Office of Intelligence and Analysis should be dismantled, as it has proven both ineffective and politicized. DHS components and the Intelligence Community (IC) already supply raw intelligence, making I&A redundant.

- **Shift remaining essential functions to the National Operations Center (NOC)** within the Office of Operations Coordination (OPS). This would ensure that classified situational awareness and operational information flow efficiently across DHS without duplicative analysis.

- **Rely on partnerships with established intelligence agencies,** such as the NSA and FBI, for cyber and critical infrastructure intelligence, streamlining and strengthening coordination efforts.

### OFFICE OF THE GENERAL COUNSEL (OGC)

#### Needed Reforms

The Office of General Counsel (OGC) should prioritize advising DHS leadership on ways to legally execute policies rather than focusing on potential obstacles.

- **Realign reporting structures.** Each component's chief counsel should report directly to their component head and indirectly to the DHS General Counsel to ensure that specific mission-related issues receive the most relevant legal guidance. This structure also maintains consistency in advice across DHS.

- **Increase political oversight of legal decisions.** More Schedule C/political appointees should be hired within OGC to supervise career staff and ensure that legal positions align with the administration's objectives, maintaining a consistent response to congressional oversight, Inspector General inquiries, and FOIA requests.

- **Invest in advanced e-discovery software** and a dedicated vendor for e-discovery management to streamline litigation responses and meet congressional oversight requests efficiently.

- **Revise document-gathering protocols** for congressional inquiries, allowing a designated office like the Chief Information Officer to collect necessary documentation promptly, thereby eliminating delays and minimizing negative press.

### OFFICE OF LEGISLATIVE AFFAIRS (OLA); OFFICE OF PUBLIC AFFAIRS (OPA); AND OFFICE OF PARTNERSHIP AND ENGAGEMENT (OPE)

#### Consolidation and Mission Alignment

DHS's external communications functions should be restructured to enhance effectiveness:

- **Merge the Office of Partnership and Engagement into the Office of Public Affairs.** This consolidation would streamline external engagement and allow DHS to operate with a more cohesive communication strategy.

- **Standardize component reporting** for public and legislative affairs, requiring that these offices report directly to their respective headquarters counterparts. This alignment ensures that DHS speaks with one voice and enables the efficient reallocation of staff to address crises or high-priority issues.

- **Limit congressional interactions to political appointees in OLA.** Appropriations and budget matters should be centralized within OLA to prevent "answer shopping" by congressional staff and ensure consistent communication.

- **Reassess congressional reporting requirements.** DHS should work with Congress to eliminate redundant or outdated reporting obligations, setting expiration dates on reporting mandates to keep requirements relevant and effective.

- **Shift focus toward representing the President and the Secretary's agendas,** rather than being a complaint resolution office for Congress or other external entities.

### OFFICE OF OPERATIONS COORDINATION (OPS)

OPS should serve as a tactical operations and coordination hub within DHS:

- **Absorb essential tactical intelligence functions from I&A,** placing these roles within the National Operations Center. Intelligence officers should support real-time operations without engaging in strategic analysis, focusing instead on direct operational needs.

- **Establish rotating billets for major DHS components** within OPS to ensure ongoing collaboration and situational awareness across DHS.

### OFFICE FOR CIVIL RIGHTS AND CIVIL LIBERTIES (CRCL) AND PRIVACY OFFICE (PRIV)

#### Streamlining and Refocusing on Core Responsibilities

The original mandate of CRCL was limited, and its scope has since grown beyond its statutory intent:

- **Restructure CRCL and PRIV under the Office of General Counsel.** With a narrower scope, CRCL should focus on equal employment opportunity and civil rights matters specific to DHS headquarters and support functions.

- **Transfer operational components' civil liberties investigations** to each component's designated officers, allowing CRCL to concentrate on policy oversight.

- **Limit PRIV's privacy protections to U.S. persons and Lawful Permanent Residents.** This aligns with the Privacy Act and ensures that privacy resources are focused on compliance rather than expanding to areas beyond statutory requirements.

- **Eliminate outside advisory boards and working groups,** limiting external engagement to the Deputy General Counsel to maintain consistent messaging and policy alignment.

### OFFICE OF THE IMMIGRATION DETENTION OMBUDSMAN (OIDO) AND OFFICE OF THE CITIZENSHIP AND IMMIGRATION SERVICES OMBUDSMAN (CISOMB)

#### Recommendations for Elimination

- **Eliminate the Office of the Immigration Detention Ombudsman (OIDO).** Oversight of detention facilities should be streamlined by consolidating responsibilities within existing ICE and CBP complaint mechanisms, reducing redundancies and bureaucratic burdens.

- **Absorb CISOMB's functions into USCIS.** Specialized casework can be managed within USCIS itself, similar to the IRS's Taxpayer Advocate model, while policy oversight can shift to the Office of Inspector General (OIG) and Government Accountability Office (GAO).

#### Alternative Measures if Offices Remain

- **Restrict OIDO to a single immigration oversight role.** Should OIDO persist, CRCL's overlapping immigration oversight duties should be shifted to OIDO to reduce duplication.

- **Prevent CISOMB from aiding illegal aliens.** The focus of the ombudsman should remain on providing fair service to lawful applicants rather than supporting individuals without legal status.

### AGENCY RELATIONSHIPS

DHS's success in implementing immigration policy and border security initiatives requires coordinated relationships across several agencies:

- **Department of Health and Human Services (HHS):** Transfer the Office of Refugee Resettlement (ORR) to DHS to streamline immigration functions, or secure HHS's full support for DHS-led immigration goals.

- **Department of Defense (DOD):** Assist in the construction of border infrastructure and deploy resources to support border security efforts, ensuring comprehensive border management.

- **Department of Justice (DOJ):** Transfer immigration-related offices, such as the Executive Office for Immigration Review and Office of Immigration Litigation, to DHS. Ensure immigration judges are classified as national security personnel, with non-union status and additional hiring resources.

- **Department of State (DOS):** Empower DHS to lead Western Hemisphere security and migration efforts, imposing sanctions on countries that fail to accept deportees.

- **Department of Labor (DOL):** Adjust policies to prevent the undercutting of American wages, including eliminating the lowest wage levels in temporary work visa programs.

- **Intelligence Community (IC):** Phase out I&A's IC status, replacing it with CBP and HSI's intelligence operations, aligning immigration and national security resources more effectively.
