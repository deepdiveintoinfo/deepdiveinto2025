The American presidency has always been a central part of our national identity. People are fascinated by it, as seen in movies, TV shows, and books that analyze and criticize it. The presidency represents the center of our country's power and influence. Still, nothing can replace real, firsthand experience. This guide gathers insights from people who worked in the White House, making it easy to understand and useful for future teams.

To understand the presidency, we should start with the Constitution. The Constitution gives the President “executive power,” making them the “Commander in Chief,” and requiring them to ensure that laws are followed. It also lets the President get help from top officials in each department. Since George Washington's time, every President has had a White House staff and a Cabinet made up of department heads to help them.

Since the late 1700s, people have chosen to dedicate their time and skills to serving the President and helping to strengthen the country. Working in the White House Office (WHO) is now seen as a valuable tradition and one of the most challenging jobs in the government.

The President relies on the team in the WHO because they cannot do everything alone. Delegating tasks is not only helpful; it is necessary. The decisions the President's team makes affect the Administration, its reputation, and the country. Choosing people who share the President's goals is one of the most important decisions at the beginning of any Administration. This choice sets the tone and direction for the whole term.

### Chief of Staff

The Chief of Staff is an Assistant to the President and is often the most important staff member for carrying out the President's vision. This person manages both the WHO staff and the Executive Office of the President (EOP).

One of the Chief of Staff's first tasks is to create an organizational chart for the WHO, showing clear lines of authority to prevent confusion. This chart includes contact points for each area of government outside the White House, including White House Liaisons chosen by the Office of Presidential Personnel (PPO).

The Chief of Staff, following the President's guidance, sets priorities for the WHO by reviewing the President's campaign promises, finding current opportunities, and assigning policy priorities to departments, agencies, and the three main policy councils:

- The National Economic Council (NEC)
- The Domestic Policy Council (DPC)
- The National Security Council (NSC)

The Chief of Staff and senior WHO staff decide on daily and weekly issues to discuss, ensuring the President is informed by the Cabinet and senior team. The Chief works with the policy councils, the Cabinet, and the Office of Communications and Office of Legislative Affairs (OLA) to carry out policies. Senior advisers, the White House Counsel, and other counselors are also closely involved.

All senior staff report to the Chief of Staff, either directly or through two or three deputies, unless the President decides otherwise. In most cases, the Chief's direct reports include two or three deputies, the Communications Director, PPO Director, White House Counsel, and senior advisers. Sometimes, the Office of Public Liaison (OPL), the Cabinet Secretary, and Intergovernmental Affairs (IGA) report directly to the Chief, but they usually report to a Deputy Chief of Staff.

The Chief of Staff's main challenge is managing time. They must balance meetings with senior staff, guidance to the WHO, and the President's needs. An effective Chief of Staff runs the West Wing by managing relationships and influencing those around them. Choosing the right Chief is very important for the Administration.

### Deputy Chiefs of Staff

Presidents often appoint two Deputy Chiefs of Staff:

1. **Deputy Chief of Staff for Management and Operations**
2. **Deputy Chief of Staff for Policy**

Some Administrations also have deputies who focus on other areas like strategy or planning. Occasionally, a principal Deputy Chief is appointed to guide decision-making, structure, and information flow.

### Principal Deputy Chiefs of Staff

Not all Chiefs of Staff appoint a principal deputy, as this can add complexity. When appointed, the principal deputy's role depends on the Chief's needs. They often handle action items themselves and pass up others to the Chief or the President, manage scheduling, and work with policy councils as directed by the Chief.

- **Deputy Chief of Staff for Management and Operations**: This deputy manages the President's schedule and all logistics, such as Air Force One and ground transportation. They work closely with the Secret Service and military offices protecting the President. This deputy may also work with the NSC, Secretary of Defense, Secretary of State, and Intelligence Community for foreign trips and should have foreign policy experience.

- **Deputy Chief of Staff for Policy**: This deputy oversees key roles in the WHO, often including the Office of Intergovernmental Affairs (IGA), Office of Public Liaison (OPL), and other advisory offices. For conservative Administrations, this role connects the WHO with state and local leaders, political groups, and grassroots organizations. This person should have strong policy knowledge, especially in economic, domestic, and social areas.

### Senior Advisers

Senior advisers are often selected for their broad experience and provide advice on political and communication issues. They might also lead specific projects or policy areas, often based on their expertise. Senior advisers usually have a close relationship with the President and give advice on both policy and communication with the public and media.

In some cases, new offices or councils are created to support senior advisers, though these may be temporary. Advisers need enough resources and clearly defined roles to work well with other teams in the White House.

### Office of White House Counsel

The Office of White House Counsel offers legal advice to the President and the EOP on issues like presidential powers, ethics, and clemency. Selecting a White House Counsel is an important decision for the President. This office does not make or push policies but ensures the President's actions follow the law.

Although the White House Counsel is not the President's personal lawyer, they should be dedicated to the President's agenda and legal boundaries. This office helps the White House follow all legal and ethical guidelines, including conflict of interest checks, financial disclosures, and training.

The Counsel's office also coordinates with the Department of Justice (DOJ) on important matters, keeping the President informed about legal challenges across the executive branch that might impact their agenda.

Attorneys in this office must be able to give reliable legal guidance quickly. The President should select a Counsel who has experience in constitutional law and government processes, and who shows strong loyalty to both the President and the Constitution.

### Staff Secretary

The Office of the Staff Secretary manages the flow of information in and out of the Oval Office. This position is essential in making sure the President has all the information needed to make decisions. The Staff Secretary reviews materials like memos, bills, and briefing books and ensures they are ready for the President.

The Staff Secretary also directs follow-up questions and manages the President's daily briefing book. They oversee official documents, including the President's signature.

### Office of Communications

The Office of Communications, led by the Communications Director, shares the President's agenda with the public through speeches, press briefings, interviews, and social media. The office works closely with the Press Office, speechwriters, and digital teams to deliver a consistent message.

The Communications Director ensures all information aligns with the President's message. The Press Secretary acts as the President's main spokesperson, delivering messages to the public and answering media questions.

The Communications Director's job is to make sure the President's message is clear and effective, requiring political skills and a strong understanding of White House activities.

### Office of Legislative Affairs (OLA)

The OLA links the White House to Congress, helping confirm presidential nominees and pass legislation. Since Congress controls federal funding, the OLA works to build support for the President's agenda.

OLA has influence on congressional leaders and works to reach consensus on the President's policies. Internally, OLA staff participate in policy discussions and advise on what Congress is likely to support. Externally, they communicate with Congress to build votes for the President's priorities.

OLA staff must be skilled in both policy and politics and able to communicate effectively on feasible policies.

### Office of Presidential Personnel (PPO)

The PPO is responsible for staffing the executive branch. Created by President Nixon, it centralizes hiring for political roles, filling around 1,000 Senate-confirmed roles and about 3,000 political positions.

The PPO handles recruiting, background checks, and hiring recommendations. They maintain a strong connection with the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) to manage the federal workforce, focusing on strategic staffing and future leadership development.

### Office of Political Affairs (OPA)

The OPA links the President with political groups, national committees, and campaigns. This office connects the White House to the President's political party, helping the Administration communicate goals to political groups and understand their concerns.

Since many White House actions affect politics, the OPA works closely with other offices to consider how decisions impact the President's image.

### Office of Cabinet Affairs (OCA)

The OCA coordinates communication between the White House and Cabinet. It organizes Cabinet meetings and communicates with senior staff. The Cabinet Secretary should be organized, with political or legal experience.

### Office of Public Liaison (OPL)

The OPL builds coalitions and supports the President's agenda by working with social, faith-based, minority, and economic groups. The OPL, a large office, has a Director who reports to the Chief of Staff and connects with senior staff in all departments. The OPL holds listening sessions with interest groups to understand their needs.

OPL staff are effective communicators, skilled at influencing others. Their roles may change as the Administration's priorities evolve.

### Office of Intergovernmental Affairs (IGA)

The IGA connects the White House to state, local, and tribal governments, making sure they understand the President's agenda. The IGA collaborates with other offices, like the OPA and OPL, and has staff focused on specific regions.

IGA staff need strong communication skills and the ability to work on complex political issues.

### White House Policy Councils

Three policy councils (NSC, NEC, and DPC) help the President manage policy across the executive branch. Each council has three main roles:

- **Policy Coordination.** The councils gather input from departments to develop policies. If there are disagreements, they present options to the President.

- **Policy Advice.** The council heads also act as policy advisers to the President, either coordinating opinions or helping to drive policy.

- **Policy Implementation.** Councils help put policy decisions into action and oversee departments.

Each council may use committees, such as:

- **Policy Coordinating Committee (PCC):** Led by a Special Assistant to the President, this includes experts from relevant departments to find areas of agreement or identify disagreements.

- **Deputies Committee (DC):** Chaired by the council's Deputy Assistant and attended by Deputy Secretaries, this reviews PCC recommendations, often adjusting options for further analysis.

- **Principals Committee (PC):** If the DC cannot resolve a question, the council Director will lead a PC meeting with senior staff and Cabinet members before bringing issues to the President.

### National Security Council

The National Security Council (NSC) is an interagency group focused on national security. Members include the President and Vice President, Secretaries of State, Defense, and Energy, and top intelligence officials. The NSC gives advice on foreign policy and national security.

### National Economic Council

The National Economic Council (NEC) oversees the President's economic agenda. The NEC coordinates economic policy, advises the President, ensures policies match the President's goals, and monitors progress.

### Domestic Policy Council

The Domestic Policy Council (DPC) advises the President on issues like health care, housing, and immigration. The DPC works closely with other offices to support economic opportunities and social policies and cooperates with the NSC on border security.

### Office of the Vice President (OVP)

The Vice President acts as a close adviser and helps the President with the Administration's goals. The VP's office is often in the West Wing for close involvement. The VP can lead projects, break Senate tie votes, and represent the Administration abroad.

### Office of the First Lady/First Gentleman

The First Lady or First Gentleman supports the President's agenda by focusing on social issues. Since the First Spouse is not an elected official, they can address sensitive topics. The First Spouse usually has a Chief of Staff and a team in the East Wing, working on projects like bullying, drug abuse, and fitness.
