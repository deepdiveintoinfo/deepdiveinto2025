analysis={stakeholder:"This stakeholder analysis evaluates the content of the first chapter of *Project 2025* titled \"White House Office.\" It critically examines the chapter’s structure, objectives, and the roles outlined, as well as their potential implications for stakeholders within and outside the administration. \n\n## **Purpose of the Chapter**\nThe chapter lays out the framework for organizing the White House Office (WHO) under the President, detailing its key roles, functions, and priorities. The narrative emphasizes centralizing power, ensuring alignment with the President's agenda, and maintaining tight operational control across all executive branches.\n\nWhile it provides insight into the functioning of the WHO, the language leans heavily on a centralized, hierarchical view of governance. This raises questions about the potential for neglecting broader perspectives and diversity of thought in decision-making processes.\n\n## **Key Stakeholders**\n\n### **1. The President**\n- **Role**: Central decision-maker, delegating power to WHO staff.\n- **Impact**: Gains efficiency and control through a structured WHO but risks over-reliance on a limited circle of advisers.\n- **Consideration**: The strong emphasis on loyalty may hinder dissenting opinions, which are critical for balanced governance.\n\n### **2. Chief of Staff and Deputies**\n- **Role**: Gatekeepers and operational managers for the WHO and Executive Office of the President (EOP).\n- **Impact**: Hold significant influence over policy implementation and agenda-setting.\n- **Consideration**: The hierarchical approach risks creating bottlenecks, overburdening key individuals, and potentially sidelining less powerful voices.\n\n### **3. White House Staff**\n- **Role**: Execute the President’s agenda across various offices (e.g., Communications, Legislative Affairs, Public Liaison).\n- **Impact**: Structured roles promote focus and alignment but may suppress creativity or initiative if roles are overly rigid.\n- **Consideration**: The emphasis on loyalty and efficiency could disincentivize staff from raising concerns or proposing innovative solutions.\n\n### **4. External Stakeholders (Congress, Media, Public)**\n- **Role**: Interact with WHO offices (e.g., Office of Legislative Affairs, Office of Communications).\n- **Impact**: Depend on the WHO for transparency and collaboration.\n- **Consideration**: The chapter outlines tight control of messaging and relationships, which could reduce transparency and erode trust.\n\n### **5. Interest Groups and Grassroots Organizations**\n- **Role**: Represent public interests and align with or oppose the President’s agenda.\n- **Impact**: Managed through offices like the Office of Public Liaison (OPL), which aims to build coalitions and address concerns.\n- **Consideration**: A transactional approach to stakeholder engagement risks alienating groups with differing viewpoints.\n\n## **Themes and Concerns**\n\n### **1. Centralization of Power**\nThe chapter repeatedly emphasizes centralized control and alignment with the President’s agenda. While this promotes efficiency, it may limit diverse perspectives. Historical lessons suggest that overly centralized systems can lead to groupthink and policy blind spots.\n\n### **2. Loyalty vs. Expertise**\nThe focus on loyalty over credentials (e.g., in the Office of White House Counsel) raises concerns about whether the most qualified individuals will hold critical roles. This could affect the quality of policy advice and implementation.\n\n### **3. Exclusion of Dissenting Voices**\nBy prioritizing strict alignment with the President's agenda, the framework discourages dissenting opinions. Effective decision-making often requires a mix of supportive and critical voices to evaluate policies from multiple angles.\n\n### **4. Role of Communication**\nThe Office of Communications is tasked with controlling the narrative and ensuring unity in public messaging. However, the emphasis on navigating “mainstream media” suggests an adversarial stance that could hinder open communication and public trust.\n\n## **Recommendations**\n\n1. **Enhance Inclusivity**: Introduce mechanisms to include diverse viewpoints within the decision-making process, such as advisory boards or stakeholder forums.\n\n2. **Balance Loyalty and Expertise**: Establish clear criteria that prioritize qualifications and experience for critical roles while ensuring alignment with the administration’s goals.\n\n3. **Promote Transparency**: Strengthen transparency through regular updates to Congress, media, and the public to build trust and accountability.\n\n4. **Foster Constructive Dissent**: Encourage feedback loops within the WHO that allow for dissenting opinions and alternative solutions to be considered before decisions are finalized.\n\n5. **Engage Stakeholders Proactively**: Develop a more collaborative approach to interacting with Congress, interest groups, and state/local governments to build long-term relationships and mutual trust.\n\n## **Potential Risks**\n- **Overconcentration of Power**: Could lead to inefficiencies or misuse of authority.\n- **Public Perception**: A tightly controlled narrative might be perceived as lacking transparency, reducing public trust.\n- **Internal Friction**: Strict hierarchies and unclear delegations of authority could lead to conflicts or inefficiencies among staff.\n\nThis chapter provides a thorough operational blueprint but exhibits a tone that prioritizes efficiency and control over inclusivity and accountability. While these qualities are essential in governance, they must be balanced with transparency, collaboration, and respect for diverse perspectives to achieve sustainable and effective leadership.\n",risk:"## **1. Centralization of Power**\n- **Risk**: Over-concentration of authority in the Chief of Staff and White House Office (WHO) staff could lead to inefficiencies, bottlenecks, or groupthink.\n- **Likelihood**: High. The chapter emphasizes a strict hierarchical structure with significant reliance on key individuals.\n- **Impact**: High. Decision-making processes may exclude dissenting voices, resulting in less innovative or balanced policy solutions.\n- **Mitigation**: Introduce structured feedback mechanisms to incorporate diverse perspectives and reduce reliance on a few key roles.\n\n## **2. Emphasis on Loyalty Over Expertise**\n- **Risk**: Prioritizing loyalty in appointments may undermine the effectiveness and competency of the staff, particularly in critical roles like White House Counsel.\n- **Likelihood**: Moderate to High. The chapter explicitly values alignment with the President’s agenda over professional qualifications in some roles.\n- **Impact**: High. Misaligned or underqualified staff may produce subpar legal, policy, or operational outcomes.\n- **Mitigation**: Establish clearer qualification criteria for appointments, balancing loyalty with expertise.\n\n## **3. Adversarial Relationship with Media**\n- **Risk**: Controlling narratives through the Office of Communications could erode transparency and trust with the media and the public.\n- **Likelihood**: High. The chapter outlines strategies that prioritize controlling the message over open engagement.\n- **Impact**: Moderate to High. Reduced trust in White House communications may limit public buy-in for policies.\n- **Mitigation**: Promote openness by balancing narrative control with proactive transparency efforts.\n\n## **4. Partisan Focus**\n- **Risk**: Overemphasis on conservative priorities, such as countering “wokeism,” could alienate bipartisan stakeholders and exacerbate political polarization.\n- **Likelihood**: Moderate to High. The chapter’s framing of priorities aligns narrowly with a partisan agenda.\n- **Impact**: High. This could limit the administration’s ability to collaborate effectively across political divides.\n- **Mitigation**: Broaden the focus of policies to address issues of universal concern alongside partisan priorities.\n\n## **5. Duplication and Overlap**\n- **Risk**: Overlapping responsibilities between offices (e.g., White House Policy Councils) may lead to inefficiencies and conflicts.\n- **Likelihood**: Moderate. The chapter acknowledges the potential for confusion in policy coordination.\n- **Impact**: Moderate. Delays or conflicting directives could undermine effective policy implementation.\n- **Mitigation**: Clearly define roles and responsibilities to reduce overlap and streamline coordination.\n\n## **6. External Stakeholder Alienation**\n- **Risk**: A transactional approach to Congress, interest groups, and state/local governments may damage long-term relationships.\n- **Likelihood**: Moderate to High. The chapter emphasizes alignment with the President’s agenda over mutual collaboration.\n- **Impact**: High. Alienated stakeholders may obstruct or fail to support key initiatives.\n- **Mitigation**: Foster collaborative relationships that build trust and shared goals over transactional exchanges.\n",policy:"## **Policy Objective: Centralized Coordination of the White House Office (WHO)**\n- **Stated Goal**: Establish a tightly controlled, hierarchical structure in the White House Office to streamline decision-making and ensure alignment with the President’s agenda.\n- **Strengths**:\n  - Provides clarity in roles and responsibilities, ensuring that tasks are delegated efficiently and lines of authority are respected.\n  - Reduces redundancy and potential conflicts between offices by promoting a unified chain of command.\n  - Facilitates rapid implementation of the President’s directives, enhancing the administration’s ability to respond to emerging challenges.\n- **Weaknesses**:\n  - Risks creating an over-reliance on a few key individuals, such as the Chief of Staff, which could slow processes if those individuals are overburdened or unavailable.\n  - Centralization may limit input from diverse viewpoints, leading to groupthink and less innovative solutions.\n  - Strict top-down control could demoralize staff, reducing engagement and willingness to challenge potentially flawed ideas.\n- **Recommendations**:\n  - Incorporate advisory panels or cross-functional teams to ensure a broader range of perspectives informs decision-making.\n  - Use digital tools or delegation frameworks to distribute the workload more evenly among senior staff.\n  - Regularly evaluate the effectiveness of the centralized structure and adjust to address bottlenecks or morale concerns.\n\n\n## **Policy Area: Staffing and Personnel Selection**\n- **Stated Goal**: Prioritize loyalty and alignment with the President’s agenda when selecting staff, particularly for critical roles like Chief of Staff and White House Counsel.\n- **Strengths**:\n  - Ensures that staff are fully committed to advancing the President’s goals without internal opposition or subversion.\n  - Promotes a cohesive team environment, minimizing the risk of conflicting priorities within the White House.\n- **Weaknesses**:\n  - Overemphasis on loyalty risks sidelining highly qualified candidates who may offer valuable expertise but hold differing viewpoints.\n  - This approach could create a culture where staff are reluctant to offer critical feedback, weakening decision-making processes.\n  - Key roles like White House Counsel may suffer from reduced independence, potentially compromising legal advice that should safeguard the administration.\n- **Recommendations**:\n  - Develop criteria that balance loyalty with qualifications, emphasizing experience and technical expertise for critical legal, policy, and managerial roles.\n  - Establish systems where staff can provide feedback confidentially to ensure critical perspectives are heard.\n  - Encourage open dialogue within senior leadership meetings to foster a culture of constructive dissent.\n\n\n## **Policy Area: Communications Strategy**\n- **Stated Goal**: Control public narratives through centralized communications, ensuring consistency across all White House messaging platforms.\n- **Strengths**:\n  - Creates a unified message that enhances public understanding of the administration’s priorities and positions.\n  - Reduces the risk of contradictory statements by different offices, which could undermine credibility.\n  - Provides the administration with a platform to push back against misinformation or negative press.\n- **Weaknesses**:\n  - Tight control over narratives may foster distrust among the press and public, particularly if the administration is perceived as opaque or overly defensive.\n  - An adversarial approach to the media could reduce the White House’s ability to collaborate with journalists and shape coverage positively.\n  - Excessive focus on controlling narratives may detract from engaging with critics or addressing legitimate public concerns.\n- **Recommendations**:\n  - Develop a proactive media engagement strategy that balances control with openness, such as regular press briefings and transparent reporting on key issues.\n  - Foster stronger relationships with journalists and media organizations to reduce adversarial dynamics.\n  - Establish internal review processes to ensure communications are truthful, consistent, and aligned with the administration’s goals.\n\n\n## **Policy Area: Collaboration with External Stakeholders**\n- **Stated Goal**: Leverage relationships with Congress, interest groups, and state/local governments to advance the President’s agenda.\n- **Strengths**:\n  - Promotes alignment between the executive branch and external entities, ensuring support for the administration’s policies and appointments.\n  - Facilitates the passage of legislation and confirmation of nominees through strategic engagement with Congress.\n  - Builds coalitions with interest groups to amplify support for key initiatives.\n- **Weaknesses**:\n  - A transactional approach to stakeholders may erode trust and damage long-term relationships, particularly with bipartisan or non-aligned groups.\n  - Framing priorities narrowly around conservative goals, such as countering “wokeism,” risks alienating moderate or opposition stakeholders.\n  - Overemphasis on political alignment may reduce opportunities for collaboration on broader, bipartisan issues.\n- **Recommendations**:\n  - Develop a more inclusive stakeholder engagement framework that seeks input from a wide range of groups, including those with differing perspectives.\n  - Balance partisan priorities with initiatives that address universal concerns to foster broader support.\n  - Invest in long-term relationship-building efforts with state and local governments, ensuring that collaboration extends beyond immediate political needs.\n",linguistic:'## **1. Use of Language to Emphasize Authority**\n- **Observation**: The chapter repeatedly uses language that reinforces the authority of the President and the White House Office. Phrases like "Commander in Chief" and "the executive Power" draw directly from the Constitution to lend weight to the argument for centralized control.\n- **Effect**: By invoking foundational and legalistic terms, the text creates an impression of unchallengeable authority, aligning the organization of the White House Office with constitutional imperatives.\n- **Implication**: This framing subtly positions dissent or alternative approaches as contrary to the nation’s core principles, reducing the space for critique.\n\n\n## **2. Framing of Roles and Loyalty**\n- **Observation**: Terms like “loyalty,” “commitment,” and “alignment” are used frequently to describe staffing priorities. Loyalty is prioritized over expertise, particularly in references to the White House Counsel and senior advisers.\n- **Effect**: This language diminishes the perceived value of independent thought or specialized knowledge, suggesting that adherence to the President’s agenda is the most critical attribute for staff.\n- **Implication**: Such framing raises questions about whether the administration values input that challenges or refines its agenda.\n\n\n## **3. Partisan Framing**\n- **Observation**: The chapter includes explicit partisan language, particularly in references to combating "wokeism," promoting conservative values, and opposing the "Left\'s aggressive attacks."\n- **Effect**: These terms evoke strong reactions and align the document with a specific ideological perspective. They position the agenda as a defense against perceived threats, rallying support within a conservative framework.\n- **Implication**: The use of such language risks alienating broader audiences and framing policy as a culture war rather than governance.\n\n\n## **4. Historical Anchoring**\n- **Observation**: The text frequently references historical figures like George Washington and constitutional principles, tying modern operations to longstanding traditions.\n- **Effect**: This creates a sense of continuity and legitimacy, framing the proposed structure as a natural evolution of American governance.\n- **Implication**: While effective rhetorically, this strategy obscures the document’s modern ideological shifts by presenting them as inherent to the nation’s founding principles.\n\n\n## **5. Repetition of Key Themes**\n- **Observation**: Words like “agenda,” “alignment,” and “control” are repeated throughout the chapter.\n- **Effect**: This repetition reinforces the importance of a unified, hierarchical structure and unwavering support for the President’s goals.\n- **Implication**: The persistent focus on control and alignment reduces emphasis on collaboration, inclusivity, or transparency, potentially alienating diverse stakeholders.\n',critical:"## **1. Focus on Centralization**\n- **Observation**: The chapter emphasizes a tightly centralized structure in the White House Office (WHO), with significant authority concentrated in the Chief of Staff and a select group of senior staff.\n- **Strengths**:\n  - Centralization facilitates rapid decision-making and ensures alignment with the President's agenda.\n  - Clear lines of authority reduce ambiguity in roles and responsibilities.\n- **Weaknesses**:\n  - Centralized power risks creating bottlenecks, as decision-making becomes overly reliant on a few key individuals.\n  - Lack of checks and balances within the White House Office could lead to groupthink and hinder adaptability.\n  - The absence of mechanisms for incorporating dissent or diverse viewpoints could limit innovative policymaking.\n- **Implications**: A rigid hierarchy may improve operational efficiency in the short term but could undermine long-term resilience and trust in governance.\n\n\n## **2. Loyalty vs. Expertise in Staffing**\n- **Observation**: The chapter prioritizes loyalty over expertise, particularly in roles like White House Counsel and senior advisers, where alignment with the President’s agenda is deemed essential.\n- **Strengths**:\n  - Loyal staff ensure a unified approach to implementing the President’s agenda.\n  - Reduces internal conflict or competing priorities among the staff.\n- **Weaknesses**:\n  - Overemphasis on loyalty may lead to the appointment of underqualified individuals, weakening the administration's capacity to address complex challenges.\n  - Undermines the role of independent advisors who could provide critical, objective perspectives.\n  - Staff may hesitate to raise concerns, fearing repercussions for challenging the agenda.\n- **Implications**: This approach risks creating a closed system where decisions are insulated from constructive criticism, leading to potential blind spots.\n\n\n## **3. Partisan Orientation**\n- **Observation**: The chapter’s focus on combating “wokeism” and “the Left’s aggressive attacks” positions the administration’s priorities within a highly partisan framework.\n- **Strengths**:\n  - Resonates strongly with a conservative base, ensuring political cohesion and support.\n  - Provides clear ideological direction for policy initiatives.\n- **Weaknesses**:\n  - Frames governance as a zero-sum conflict, reducing opportunities for bipartisan collaboration.\n  - Alienates moderate or opposition stakeholders who may otherwise support certain policies.\n  - Risks polarizing national discourse, undermining public trust in government institutions.\n- **Implications**: The overtly partisan tone may energize a base but hinders the administration’s ability to address broader national concerns inclusively.\n\n\n## **4. Transparency and Accountability**\n- **Observation**: The chapter emphasizes control over messaging and alignment with the President’s agenda but provides little attention to transparency or mechanisms for accountability.\n- **Strengths**:\n  - Streamlined messaging enhances public understanding of the administration’s priorities.\n  - Reduces conflicting narratives that could weaken the administration’s image.\n- **Weaknesses**:\n  - Tight control over information risks creating an impression of opacity, eroding public trust.\n  - Lack of emphasis on accountability mechanisms leaves the administration vulnerable to ethical or operational failures.\n- **Implications**: A perceived lack of transparency could undermine the administration’s credibility, particularly during crises or controversies.\n\n\n## **5. Historical Framing**\n- **Observation**: The chapter uses references to historical figures like George Washington and constitutional principles to anchor its proposals in tradition.\n- **Strengths**:\n  - Provides a sense of legitimacy and continuity, reinforcing the importance of the White House Office.\n  - Appeals to patriotic sentiment, strengthening the connection between modern governance and historical values.\n- **Weaknesses**:\n  - Historical framing obscures the modern ideological shifts embedded in the proposals.\n  - Creates a narrative where dissent or alternative approaches may seem inconsistent with tradition.\n- **Implications**: The selective use of history bolsters the administration’s agenda rhetorically but risks alienating those who interpret these traditions differently.\n",comparative:"## **1. Comparison of Centralization with Other Governance Models**\n- **Observation**: The chapter advocates for a centralized hierarchy within the White House Office (WHO), with the Chief of Staff and senior advisers wielding significant authority. This approach contrasts with governance models that favor distributed decision-making or collaborative structures.\n- **Strengths**:\n  - Centralized models, like those used in corporate or military structures, can facilitate rapid decision-making and clear accountability.\n  - Alignment with the President’s agenda ensures policy cohesion.\n- **Weaknesses**:\n  - Distributed governance models, such as those emphasizing collaborative decision-making (e.g., Scandinavian governments or NGO leadership), often result in more inclusive and innovative policies due to diverse input.\n  - Centralized structures risk bottlenecks, reduced adaptability, and overreliance on a few individuals.\n- **Implication**: The centralized approach may excel in maintaining short-term control but lacks the inclusivity and adaptability that collaborative models offer.\n\n\n## **2. Framing of Loyalty vs. Expertise**\n- **Observation**: The chapter emphasizes loyalty to the President as the primary criterion for staff selection, diverging from frameworks that prioritize professional expertise (e.g., merit-based systems in civil services or international institutions like the United Nations).\n- **Strengths**:\n  - Loyalty ensures alignment with leadership priorities, as seen in political campaign teams or executive leadership in startups.\n  - Reduces internal conflicts stemming from divergent agendas.\n- **Weaknesses**:\n  - Merit-based approaches, such as those used in technocratic administrations (e.g., Germany), tend to deliver more technically sound and effective policies.\n  - Overemphasis on loyalty risks groupthink and limits critical evaluation of policies.\n- **Implication**: While loyalty-based systems ensure cohesion, they are often less effective at handling complex or technical challenges requiring high levels of expertise.\n\n\n## **3. Partisan Framing vs. Neutral Governance**\n- **Observation**: The chapter adopts a partisan tone, framing priorities as combating “wokeism” and “the Left’s aggressive attacks.” This contrasts with nonpartisan or bipartisan approaches seen in some international and state-level governance models.\n- **Strengths**:\n  - Partisan approaches energize a political base, ensuring strong internal support, as seen in U.S. campaign politics or issue-driven advocacy organizations.\n  - Clear ideological positioning can simplify messaging and rally supporters.\n- **Weaknesses**:\n  - Bipartisan frameworks, such as those seen in coalition governments (e.g., New Zealand or Germany), foster broader public trust and inclusivity.\n  - Partisan rhetoric risks polarizing discourse, reducing opportunities for collaboration and alienating moderate stakeholders.\n- **Implication**: Partisan framing strengthens ideological alignment but reduces the administration’s ability to appeal to or collaborate with a diverse audience.\n\n\n## **4. Historical Framing vs. Modernization**\n- **Observation**: The chapter frequently references historical figures like George Washington and the Constitution to frame its proposals. This contrasts with governance models that emphasize modernity and innovation (e.g., Singapore’s technocratic model).\n- **Strengths**:\n  - Historical framing provides legitimacy and continuity, resonating with cultural and national identity, as seen in the U.S. and U.K.\n  - Reinforces a sense of tradition and stability, appealing to conservative audiences.\n- **Weaknesses**:\n  - Modernization-driven models prioritize innovation and adaptability, addressing contemporary challenges more effectively.\n  - Excessive reliance on historical framing risks appearing disconnected from current realities and challenges.\n- **Implication**: Historical framing strengthens cultural resonance but may obscure the need for modernization in governance strategies.\n\n\n## **5. Transparency and Accountability**\n- **Observation**: The chapter emphasizes control over messaging and narrative alignment but lacks mechanisms for transparency, contrasting with open government initiatives (e.g., Sweden’s principle of public access to official documents).\n- **Strengths**:\n  - Controlled messaging ensures consistency, reducing public confusion, as seen in corporate crisis communications.\n  - Protects internal deliberations from external pressures, enabling focused policy development.\n- **Weaknesses**:\n  - Open government initiatives enhance public trust and accountability, particularly in Scandinavian countries and global NGOs.\n  - Lack of transparency risks eroding public confidence, particularly in times of crisis.\n- **Implication**: Controlled messaging may ensure short-term consistency but undermines long-term public trust and accountability.\n",accessibility:"## **1. Linguistic Accessibility**\n- **Observation**: The language of the chapter is formal, with frequent references to historical figures, constitutional principles, and technical government structures.\n- **Strengths**:\n  - Provides a tone of authority and legitimacy, suitable for an audience familiar with government operations or legal frameworks.\n  - Reinforces the document's connection to tradition and constitutional principles, appealing to a specific demographic with advanced literacy and knowledge of U.S. history.\n- **Weaknesses**:\n  - Use of formal and legalistic language limits accessibility for readers with lower literacy levels or limited familiarity with governmental terms.\n  - Frequent use of jargon (e.g., “principal Officer,” “EOP,” “detailees”) without adequate explanation makes the content less approachable for a general audience.\n- **Implication**: The text assumes a knowledgeable audience, potentially alienating readers unfamiliar with these references or with lower literacy levels.\n\n\n## **2.

It has played, for instance, a feature role in innumerable movies and television shows and has been prodded, analyzed, and critiqued by countless books, essays, and studies. But like nearly everything else in life, there is no substitute for firsthand experience, which this manual has compiled from the experience of presidential appointees and provides in accessible form for future use.\n\nWith respect to the presidency, it is best to begin with our Republic's foundational document. The Constitution gives the “executive Power” to the President.  \nIt designates him as “Commander in Chief” and gives him the responsibility to “take Care that the Laws be faithfully executed.” It further prescribes that the President might seek the assistance of “the principal Officer in each of the executive Departments.” Beginning with George Washington, every President has been supported by some form of White House office consisting of direct staff officers as well as a Cabinet comprised of department and agency heads.\n\nSince the inaugural Administration of the late 18th century, citizens have chosen to devote both their time and their talent to defending and strengthening our nation by serving at the pleasure of the President. Their shared patriotic endeavor has proven to be a noble one, not least because the jobs in what is now known as the White House Office (WHO) are among the most demanding in all of government.\n\nThe President must rely on the men and women appointed to the WHO. There simply are not enough hours in the day to manage the affairs of state single-handedly, so delegation is not just advisable: It is essential. The decisions that assistants and senior advisers make will directly impact the Administration, its legacy, and—most important—the fate of the country. Their agenda must therefore be the President's agenda. Choosing who will carry out that agenda on a daily basis is not only one of the first decisions a President makes in office but also one of the most critical. The tone and tempo of an administration are often determined on January 20.\n\n### Chief of Staff\n\nAs with most of the positions that will be covered in this first chapter, the Chief of Staff is also an Assistant to the President. However, the chief is truly first among equals. Of all presidential staff members, the chief is the most critical to implementation of the President's vision for the country. The chief also has a dual role as manager of the staffs of both the WHO and the Executive Office of the President (EOP).\n\nThe Chief of Staff's first managerial task is to establish an organizational chart for the WHO. It should be simple and contain clear lines of authority and responsibility to avoid conflicts. It should also identify specific points of contact for each element of the government outside of the White House. These contacts should include the White House Liaisons who are selected by the Office of Presidential Personnel (PPO).\n\nReceiving guidance from the President, the chief endeavors to implement the President's agenda by setting priorities for the WHO. This process begins by taking stock of the President's campaign promises, identifying current and prospective opportunities, and then delegating policy priorities among the departments and agencies of the Cabinet and throughout the three White House policy councils:\n\n- The National Economic Council (NEC)\n- The Domestic Policy Council (DPC)\n- The National Security Council (NSC)\n\nThe President is briefed on all of his policy priorities by his Cabinet and senior staff as directed by the chief. The chief—along with senior WHO staff—maps out the issues and themes that will be covered daily and weekly. The chief then works with the policy councils, the Cabinet, and the Office of Communications and Office of Legislative Affairs (OLA) to sequence and execute the rollout of policies and announcements. White House Counsel and senior advisers and senior counselors are also intimately involved.\n\nAll senior staff report to the Chief of Staff, either directly or through his two or three deputies, unless the President determines that a particular Assistant to the President reports directly to him. Most chiefs have interacted directly with Cabinet officers and a select number of direct reports. In most cases, the direct reports to the chief are his two or three deputies, the Communications Director, PPO Director, White House Counsel, and senior advisers. Occasionally, the Office of Public Liaison (OPL), the Cabinet Secretary, and Intergovernmental Affairs (IGA) also report directly to the chief. Usually, however, they report instead to a Deputy Chief of Staff.\n\nThe Chief of Staff's main challenge is time management. His use of his deputies, meetings with senior staff, and direction provided to the WHO must all balance with the daily needs of the President. A successful chief steers the West Wing using his management of and influence with the various individuals and entities around him. It goes without saying that selecting the right person to be chief is vital.\n\n### Deputy Chiefs of Staff\n\nIn recent years, Presidents typically have appointed two Deputy Chiefs of Staff:\n\n1. **Deputy Chief of Staff for Management and Operations**\n2. **Deputy Chief of Staff for Policy**\n\nThere also have been other types of deputy chiefs whose roles have included, for example, overseeing strategy, planning, and implementation. Chiefs of Staff have then occasionally appointed a principal Deputy Chief to be in charge of guiding decision-making, organizational structure, and information flow.\n\n### Principal Deputy Chiefs of Staff\n\nNot all Chiefs of Staff have tapped a principal deputy. A major reason is that doing so adds another layer of command complexity. When principal deputies have been installed, their roles have varied based on the needs of particular chiefs. Most principal deputies have functioned as doorkeepers, sorting through action items, taking on those that can be handled at their own level, and passing up others that truly require the attention of the Chief of Staff or the President. Principal deputies also have assumed control of the scheduling functions, normally under the operations deputy, and have worked directly with the policy councils at the direction of the Chief of Staff. The OPL and Office of Political Affairs (OPA) also have reported to a principal deputy.\n\n- **Deputy Chief of Staff for Management and Operations**: The Deputy Chief of Staff for Management and Operations oversees the President's schedule and all logistical aspects of his movement within and outside of the White House (for example, both air travel on Air Force One and Marine One and ground transportation). This deputy also interfaces directly with the Secret Service as well as the military offices tasked with keeping the President and his family safe.\n\n  In the past, this deputy has also worked with the NSC, the Secretary of Defense, the Secretary of State, and the Intelligence Community on advancing all foreign trips. If their roles are separated from that of the policy deputy, this deputy should have a strong grasp of international affairs and robust foreign policy credentials.\n\n  This deputy further manages all facets of the working White House: technology, grounds management, support staff, personnel administration, and communications. This individual therefore needs to be meticulous and ideally should possess a great deal of command-and-control experience.\n\n- **Deputy Chief of Staff for Policy**: In some Administrations, the functions of the IGA, OPA, and OPL and other advisers within the WHO have fallen under the Deputy Chief of Staff for Policy. For conservatives, this arrangement could help to connect the WHO's outreach to political and external groups and be a strong conduit for state and local elected officials, state party organizations, and both grasstop and grassroots groups.\n\n  This deputy chief works directly with the Chief of Staff, Cabinet officers, and all three policy councils to support the development and implementation of the President's agenda. This deputy chief should therefore have impressive policy credentials in the realms of economic, domestic, and social affairs.\n\n### Senior Advisers\n\nPresidents have surrounded themselves with senior advisers whose experience and interests are not necessarily neatly defined. In recent Administrations, senior advisers have been appointed to offer broad guidance on political matters and communications issues; others have acted as “czars” for specific projects or policy areas.\n\nThe most powerful senior advisers frequently have had a long personal relationship with the President and often have spent a significant amount of time with him within and outside of the White House. They have been asked not only to provide guidance on a variety of policy issues, but also to offer instruction on communicating with the American people and the media.\n\nIn a number of Administrations, new offices—or “councils”—have been created to support senior advisers. For the most part, their functions have been duplicative or overlapping, as a result of which these offices have tended to be short-lived. Even so, senior advisers should be provided the staff and resources that their portfolios require. To ensure that senior advisers are effective, their portfolios must be clearly delineated and clearly communicated across the White House. This too is a responsibility of the Chief of Staff.\n\n### Office of White House Counsel\n\nThe Office of White House Counsel provides legal guidance to the President and elements of the EOP on a host of issues, including presidential powers and privileges, ethics compliance, review of clemency applications, and judicial nominations. The selection of White House Counsel is one of the most important decisions an incoming President will make. The office is not designed to create or advance policies on its own initiative—nor should it do so. Rather, it is dedicated to guiding the President and his reports on how (within the bounds of the law) to pursue and realize the President's agenda.\n\nWhile the White House Counsel does not serve as the President's personal attorney in nonofficial matters, it is almost impossible to delineate exactly where an issue is strictly personal and has no bearing on the President's official function. The White House Counsel needs to be deeply committed both to the President's agenda and to affording the President proactive counsel and zealous representation. That individual directly advises the President as he performs the duties of the office, and this requires a relationship that is built on trust, confidentiality, and candor.\n\nThe Office of White House Counsel is also responsible for ensuring that each component of the White House adheres to all applicable legal and ethical guidelines, which often requires ongoing training and monitoring to ensure compliance. This means ensuring that White House staff regularly consult with office attorneys on required financial disclosures, received gifts, potential conflicts of interest, and other ethical concerns. The Office of White House Counsel is the first line of defense for the EOP. Its staff must take seriously the duty to protect the powers and privileges of the President from encroachments by Congress, the judiciary, and the administrative components of departments and agencies.\n\nIn addition to the White House Counsel, the office includes deputies, assistants, associates, and legal support staff. The assistant and associate attorneys are often specialists in particular areas of the law and offer guidance to the EOP on issues related to national security, criminal law, environmental law, and a host of administrative and regulatory matters. Attorneys working in the Office of White House Counsel serve as legal advisers to the White House policy operation by reviewing executive orders, agency regulations, and other policy-related functions. Here again, subordinates should be deeply committed to the President's agenda and see their role as helping to accomplish the agenda through problem solving and advocacy. They should not erect roadblocks out of an abundance of caution; rather, they should offer practical legal advice on how to promote the President's agenda within the bounds of the law.\n\nThe White House Counsel's office cannot serve as a finishing school to credential the next set of white-shoe law firm attorneys or federal judges in waiting who cabin their opinions for fear their elite credentials could be tarnished through a policy disagreement. Rather, it should function more as an activist yet ethical plaintiffs' firm that advocates for its client—the Administration's agenda—within the limits imposed by the Constitution and the duties of the legal profession.\n\nThe Office of White House Counsel also serves as the primary gateway for communication between the White House and the Department of Justice (DOJ). Traditionally, both the White House Counsel and the Attorney General have issued a memo requiring all contact between the two institutions to occur only between the Office of White House Counsel and the Attorney General or Deputy Attorney General. The next Administration should reexamine this policy and determine whether it might be more efficient or more appropriate for communication to occur through additional channels. The White House Counsel also works closely with the DOJ Office of Legal Counsel to seek opinions on, for example, matters of policy development and the constitutionality of presidential power and privileges and with OLA and the DOJ Office of Legal Policy on presidential judicial nominees.\n\nWhen a new President takes office, he will need to decide expeditiously how to handle any major ongoing litigation or other pending legal matters that might present a challenge to his agenda. To offer guidance, the White House Counsel must get up to speed as quickly as possible on all significant ongoing legal challenges across the executive branch that might affect the new Administration's policy agenda and must be prepared at the outset of the Administration to present recommendations to the President, including recommendations for reconsidering or reversing positions of the previous Administration in any significant litigation. This review will usually require consulting with the new political leadership at the Justice Department, including during the transition period.\n\nNo day is predictable at the White House. Therefore, to handle the pace and volatility of affairs, the Office of White House Counsel must offer measured legal guidance in a timely manner. This often means forgoing law review–style memos about esoteric legal concepts and instead quickly providing high-level yet incisive guidance. Due to evolving world events, domestic affairs, and political pressures, the office often faces legal questions for which there may not be a wealth of precedent. Attorneys in the Office of White House Counsel must therefore work collaboratively within the White House and the Department of Justice, relying on each other as a team, to ensure that proper legal guidance is delivered to the President.\n\nThe President should choose a White House Counsel who is well-versed in the Constitution, administrative and regulatory law, and the inner workings of Congress and the political process. Instead of choosing a specialist, the President should hire a counsel with extensive experience with a wide range of complex legal subjects. Moreover, while a candidate with elite credentials might seem ideal, the best one will be above all loyal to the President and the Constitution.\n\n### Staff Secretary\n\nThe Office of the Staff Secretary is rarely visible to the outside world, but it performs work of tremendous importance. The office is similar to a military commander's adjutant as it is responsible for fielding and managing a vast amount of information at the top of its organization. This includes information on its way into the Oval Office as well as information flowing out from the Oval Office. Because of its gatekeeping function, the position of Staff Secretary is one of extreme trust, and the individual who possesses it should be vetted to work as an “honest broker” in the President's service.\n\nThe Office of the Staff Secretary has been described as the last substantive control point before papers reach the Oval Office. A great deal of information is headed toward the Oval Office at any moment. This includes presidential decision memos; bills passed by Congress (which may be accompanied by signing or veto statements); and briefing books, reading materials, samples of constituent mail, personal mail, and drafts of speeches. The Staff Secretary makes certain that these materials are complete, well-ordered, and up to date before they reach the President. This necessarily means that the Staff Secretary plays a key role in determining who weighs in on policy matters and when.\n\nAs noted above, the Staff Secretary also handles information leaving the Oval Office. The President may have questions after reviewing incoming material, may wish to seek more information, or may demand revisions. The Staff Secretary is often responsible for directing these requests to the appropriate places and following up on them to ensure that they are completed.\n\nOne of the Staff Secretary's critical functions is managing and overseeing the clearance process for the President's daily/nightly briefing book. This book is filled with all the reading material and leading documentation the President needs in the morning and the evening to help him make decisions. The Staff Secretary also oversees the use of the President's signature, whether by hand or by autopen, and manages the Office of the Executive Clerk, Office of Records Management, and Office of Presidential Correspondence.\n\n### Office of Communications\n\nThe Office of Communications, which operates under the Director of Communications, conveys the President's agenda to the public through various media, including speeches and remarks, press briefings, off-the-record discussions with reporters, and social media. Depending on how a President chooses to structure his White House, the Office of Communications may include the Office of the Press Secretary (Press Office), but no matter how it is structured, the office must work closely with the Press Office as well as the President's speechwriters and digital strategists.\n\nOperational functions of the Office of Communications include scheduling and running press briefings, interviews, meetings, media appearances, speeches, and a range of other events. The Office of Communications must maintain robust relationships with the White House Press Corps, the White House Correspondents' Association, regional stakeholders, and key interest groups. No legal entitlement exists for the provision of permanent space for media on the White House campus, and the next Administration should reexamine the balance between media demands and space constraints on the White House premises.\n\nLeadership within the Office of Communications should include a Communications Director (who is a direct report to the Chief of Staff), a Deputy Communications Director, a Deputy Director for Strategic Communications, and a Press Secretary. This leadership team must work together closely to drive the national narrative about the White House.\n\nThe best resource for the Office of Communications is the President. The President conveys the White House's overall message through one or two inaugural addresses, State of the Union addresses, speeches to Congress, and press conferences. The office must also ensure that the various White House offices disseminate a unified message to the public. The Communications Director and Press Secretary in particular should be careful to avoid contradicting the President or delivering conflicting information.\n\nThe speechwriting team is a critical component of the communications team. Speechwriting is a unique talent: The writers selected must understand policy, should have a firm grasp of history and other liberal-arts disciplines, and should be able to learn and adopt the President's style of rhetoric and mode of delivery.\n\nThe Press Secretary is the President's spokesperson, communicating to the American people through the media. The Press Secretary engages with the White House Press Corps formally through press briefings and informally through impromptu gaggles and meetings. Individuals who serve in this role must be quick on their feet, which means, when appropriate, deftly refuting and rebutting correspondents' questions and comments.\n\nThe Communications Director must convey the President's mission to the American people. Especially for conservatives, this means navigating the mainstream media to ensure that the President's agenda is conveyed effectively and accurately. The Communications Director must be politically savvy and very aware of the ongoing activities of the other White House offices. The new Administration should examine the nature of the relationship between itself and the White House Correspondents Association and consider whether an alternative coordinating body might be more suitable.\n\n### Office of Legislative Affairs (OLA)\n\nCreated by President Dwight Eisenhower, the OLA has continued to serve as the liaison between the White House and Congress. The White House must work with congressional leaders to ensure presidential nominees, for roles such as Cabinet secretaries and ambassadors, are confirmed by the Senate. The White House also relies on Congress to enact reforms promised by the President on the campaign trail, whether those promises relate to health care, education, or national defense. Because Congress holds the power of the purse, White House staffers must ensure that there is enough support on the Hill to secure the necessary funding through the appropriations process to fulfill the President's agenda.\n\nThe OLA reports directly to the Chief of Staff and in some Administrations has done so under the guidance of a Deputy Chief of Staff (usually the Deputy Chief for Policy). Regardless of the person to whom the OLA reports, however, the office exercises a certain autonomy on behalf of the President and the Chief of Staff in directly influencing congressional leaders of both major political parties. The OLA often must function as the mediator among the parties and find common ground to facilitate the successful enactment of the President's agenda.\n\nAs is the case with many White House offices (but especially the Office of Communications), the OLA must ensure that congressional leaders receive one unified message. If other actors within the White House maintain their own relationships with congressional leaders and staffers, it may appear that the President's agenda is fractured and lacks consensus. This dynamic has caused real problems for many Presidents in the past.\n\nInternally, OLA staffers need to be involved in policy discussions, budget reviews, and other important meetings. They must also provide advice to policy staffers regarding whether certain ideas are politically feasible. Externally, OLA staffers have to communicate continuously with congressional offices of both parties in both the House and the Senate to ensure that the President has enough support to enact his legislative priorities or sustain votes.\n\nThe OLA requires staffers who are effective communicators and can provide a dose of reality to other White House staffers when necessary. Although a policy proposal from within the White House may be a great idea, OLA staffers must ensure that it is politically feasible. OLA staffers must therefore be skilled in both politics and policy. Furthermore, the President should seek out individuals who can advance his agenda and at the same time forge pathways with members of the opposing political party on other priorities.\n\nMost important, the OLA must function as a well-oiled machine: precisely synced. The President cannot afford to have a tennis player on—much less as the leader of—his football team.\n\n### Office of Presidential Personnel (PPO)\n\nThe political axiom that “personnel is policy” was popularized under President Ronald Reagan during the 1981 presidential transition. One of the most important offices in the White House is the PPO, which was created under President Richard Nixon to centralize political appointments. Departments and agencies had and still have direct legal authority on hiring and firing, but the power to fill Schedule C positions—the core of political jobs—is vested with the President. Therefore, the White House, not the department or agency, has the final word on political appointments.\n\nPPO's primary responsibility is to staff the executive branch with individuals who are equipped to implement the President's agenda. Although its focus should be identifying and recruiting leaders to fill the approximately 1,000 appointments that require Senate confirmation, PPO must also fill approximately 3,000 political jobs that require dedicated conservatives to support the Administration's political leadership.\n\nFrequently, many medium-tier and top-tier jobs have been filled by policy experts tasked with accomplishing much of the work of the Administration. At the same time, appointees in the entry-level jobs have brought invaluable energy and commitment to the White House and have proved to be the “farm team” for the conservative movement.\n\nThe Office of Presidential Personnel is responsible for:\n\n- Identifying potential political personnel both actively through recruitment and passively by fielding resumes and adjudicating requests from political actors.\n- Vetting potential political personnel by conducting political background checks and reviewing any clearance and fitness assessments by departments and agencies.\n- Making recommendations to the President and to other appointment authorities on behalf of the President.\n- Identifying programmatic political workforce needs early and developing plans (for example, Schedule F).\n- Maintaining a strong relationship with the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) both for operational purposes and to effectuate the President's direct Title 5 authorities. The President is in charge of the federal workforce and exercises control principally by working through the Director of the Office of Personnel Management.\n- Training and connecting political personnel.\n- Playing “bad cop” in a way that other White House offices cannot (including serving as the office that takes direct responsibility for firings and hirings).\n- Serving as a personnel link between conservative organizations and the executive branch.\n\nIn most Administrations, PPO will staff more than 100 positions during a transition and thousands of noncareer positions during the President's first term. Direct authority and a strong relationship with the President are necessary attributes for any PPO Director. Historically, PPO has had direct review and control of personnel files, including security clearance dossiers.\n\nAt the highest level, PPO is tasked with long-term, strategic workforce development. The “billets” of political appointments are of immense importance in credentialing and training future leaders. In addition, whatever one's view of the constitutionality of various civil service rules (for example, the Federal Vacancies Reform Act of 1998) might be, it is necessary to ensure that departments and agencies have robust cadres of political staff just below senior levels in the event of unexpected vacancies.\n\n### Office of Political Affairs (OPA)\n\nThe OPA is the primary office within the executive branch for managing the President's political interests. Although its specific functions vary from Administration to Administration, the OPA typically serves as the liaison between the President and associated political entities: national committees, federal and state campaigns, and interest groups. Within legal guidelines, the OPA engages in outreach, conducts casework, and—if the President is up for reelection—assists with his campaign. The OPA may also monitor congressional campaigns, arrange presidential visits with other political campaigns, and recommend campaign staff to the Office of Presidential Personnel for service in the executive branch.\n\nThe OPA further serves as a line of communication between the White House and the President's political party. This includes both relaying the President's ambitions to political interests and listening to the needs of political interests. This relationship allows for the exchange of information between the White House and political actors across the country. The OPA should have one director of political affairs who reports either to the Chief of Staff or to a Deputy Chief of Staff. The OPA should also include various deputy directors, each of whom is responsible for a certain geographical region of the country.\n\nBecause nearly all White House activities are in some way inherently political, the OPA needs to be aware of all presidential actions and activities—including travel, policy decisions, speeches, nominations, and responses to matters of national security—and consider how they might affect the President's image. The OPA must therefore have a designated staffer who communicates not only with other White House offices, but also with the Cabinet and executive branch agencies.\n\n### Office of Cabinet Affairs (OCA)\n\nThe OCA's role has changed to some degree over the course of various Administrations, but its overriding function remains the same: to ensure the coordination of policy and communication between the White House and the Cabinet. Most important, the OCA coordinates all Cabinet meetings with the President. It should also organize and administer regular meetings of the Deputy Secretaries because they also typically serve vital roles in the departments and agencies and, further, often become acting secretaries when Cabinet members resign.\n\nThere should be one Cabinet Secretary who reports to the Chief of Staff's office, either directly or through a deputy chief, according to the chief's preference and focus. The Cabinet Secretary maintains a direct relationship with all members of the Cabinet.\n\nThe OCA further consists of deputies and special assistants who work with each department's principal, Deputy Secretary, Under Secretaries, Assistant Secretaries, and other senior staff. The OCA also connects the departments to WHO offices. The OCA coordinates with the Chief of Staff's office and the Office of Communications to promote the President's agenda through the Cabinet departments and agencies. The Cabinet's communications staffers are obviously another critical component of this operation.\n\nIn prior Administrations, the OCA has played a vital role by tracking the President's agenda for the Chief of Staff, Deputy Chiefs, and senior advisers. It has worked with each department and agency to advance policy priorities. In the future, amplifying this function would truly benefit both the President and the conservative movement.\n\nFrom time to time throughout an Administration, travel optics, ethics challenges, and Hatch Act issues involving Cabinet members, deputies, and senior staffers can arise. The OCA is normally tasked with keeping the WHO informed of such developments and providing support if and when necessary.\n\nThe ideal Cabinet Secretary will have exceptional organizational skills and be a seasoned political operative or attorney. Because many Cabinet officials have been former presidential candidates, governors, ambassadors, and Members of Congress, the ideal candidate should also possess the ability to interact with and persuade accomplished individuals.\n\n### Office of Public Liaison (OPL)\n\nThe OPL is critically important in building coalitions and support for the President's agenda across every aligned social, faith-based, minority, and economic interest group. It is a critical tool for shaping public opinion and keeping myriad supporters, as well as “frenemies” and opponents alike who are within reach, better informed.\n\nThe OPL is a notably large office. It should have one Director who reports to the Chief of Staff's office, either directly or through a deputy, according to the chief's preference and focus. The Director must maintain relationships not only with other WHO heads, but also with the senior staff of every Cabinet department and agency. Since a President's agenda is always in motion, it is important for the OPL to facilitate listening sessions to receive the views of the various leaders and members of key interest groups.\n\nThe OPL should also have a sufficient number of deputies and special assistants to cover the vast number of disparate interest groups that are engaged daily. The OPL has, by far, held more meetings in the Eisenhower Executive Office Building (EEOB) and within the West Wing itself than any other office within the WHO.\n\nThe OPL is the chief White House enforcer and gatekeeper among these various interest groups. It has operated best whenever the Chief of Staff has given it permission to use both the proverbial “carrot” and the proverbial “stick.” To make this work, communication with the chief's office is vital. Additionally, the OPL has had an outsized role in presidential scheduling and both official and political travel.\n\nThe OPL Director should come from the President's election campaign or Capitol Hill—but should not have deeply entrenched connections to a K Street entity or any other potential stakeholder. Some prior relationships can create real or perceived biases toward one group or another. The Director should be amiable, gregarious, highly organized, and willing to shoulder criticism and pushback from interest groups and other elements of the Administration.\n\nUnlike the Director, OPL deputies and special assistants need a deep understanding of the capital, from K Street to Capitol Hill. They should have extensive experience in private industry, the labor sector, the conservative movement, and among the specific interest groups with which they will be asked to engage on behalf of the White House.\n\nOPL staffers work with more external and internal parties than any other WHO staffers. In turn, they must be effective communicators and initiative-takers. They must also be able to influence, persuade, and—most important—listen to various stakeholders and ensure that they feel heard. All OPL staffers must understand from the outset that their jobs might be modified or even phased out entirely as the Administration's priorities change.\n\n### Office of Intergovernmental Affairs (IGA)\n\nThe IGA connects the White House to state, county, local, and tribal governments. In other words, it is the one-stop shop for disseminating an Administration's agenda to all non–federal government entities.\n\nThe IGA should have a Director to whom one or two Deputy Directors report. The Director must ensure that the White House remains connected to all non–federal government entities. The interests and perspectives of these entities are represented in policy discussions, organized events with the West Wing, EOP senior staff, and IGA staff throughout the departments and agencies.\n\nThe IGA can be staffed in a variety of ways, but two arrangements are most common:\n\n- Each deputy and that deputy's staffers are responsible for a type of government.\n- A group of staffers is responsible for a specific geographical region of the country.\n\nThe IGA, as suggested above, represents the interests and perspectives of non–federal government entities, but its primary job is to make sure that these entities understand an Administration's agenda and ultimately support it.\n\nThe IGA must work with all other White House offices, especially the OPA and the OPL, and manage its staff throughout the departments and agencies. IGA staffers must therefore have communication skills, understand political nuance, and be willing to engage in complex policy discussions. They should also be not just generally responsive, but also proactive in seeking out the interests and perspectives of non–federal government entities.\n\n### White House Policy Councils\n\nAs the federal government has ballooned in size over the past century, it has become increasingly difficult for the President alone to direct his agenda across the executive branch. Three White House policy councils have come into existence to help the President to control the bureaucracy and ensure continued alignment between agency leadership and White House priorities. Those councils—as previewed above—are the NSC, NEC, and DPC. Each is headed by an Assistant to the President and performs three significant functions.\n\n- **Policy Coordination.** The primary role of the policy councils is to coordinate the development of Administration policy. This frequently includes developing significant legislative priorities, coordinating policy decisions that impact multiple departments and agencies, and at times coordinating policy decisions within a single department or agency. This process must ensure that all relevant offices are included; that competing or conflicting opinions are thoroughly discussed and evaluated; and, when there is disagreement among White House senior staff or among Cabinet members, a well-structured question is presented to the President for an intermediate or final decision.\n\n- **Policy Advice.** By virtue of working in the White House, the heads of the three policy councils will also function as independent policy advisers to the President. This aspect of the role will vary depending on the individual in this position and the President's governing philosophy. Incumbents have ranged from “honest brokers,” who mostly coordinate and ensure that all opinions are fairly presented to the President, to “policy deciders,” who largely drive a given policy topic on behalf of the President.\n\n- **Policy Implementation.** The policy councils also manage and mediate the implementation of previous policy decisions. Implementation of a new statute or an executive order frequently takes years and involves many distinct and more granular policy decisions along the way. It is essential to have a centralized process for evaluating and coordinating these decisions, especially if they involve more than one Cabinet department or agency with differing opinions on the best approach for securing the President's goals.\n\nThe above functions have recently been managed by policy councils through a tiered interagency policy process. This process helps to identify differences of opinion and reach a decision without having to take every issue to the President. It can be used to address a single question or monitor a recurring issue on an ongoing basis. Typically, the process involves multiple Cabinet departments and agencies that have a pertinent role, policy interest, or disagreement. Each policy council's process could involve the following committees:\n\n- **Policy Coordinating Committee (PCC):** A PCC is led by a Special Assistant to the President from the policy council and includes political Assistant Secretary–level experts from the relevant departments, agencies, or offices. The purpose is to determine where consensus exists, clearly identify where there are differing opinions, and develop options for resolving the remaining questions. If no outstanding questions or disagreements exist, the PCC may resolve the issue and move toward implementation at the agency level.\n\n- **Deputies Committee (DC):** A DC is a meeting of presidentially appointed executives chaired by the policy council's Deputy Assistant to the President and relevant Deputy Secretaries. It evaluates the options produced by the PCC and frequently directs the PCC to add, expand, or reevaluate an option or even to reach a compromise and resolve an issue at that level.\n\n- **Principals Committee (PC):** When questions are not resolved by a DC, the Director of the Policy Council will chair a PC, which is attended by the relevant Cabinet Secretaries and senior White House political staff. This is the final opportunity for the President's most senior advisers to discuss the question, make sure that each principal's position is carefully understood, and see whether consensus or a compromise might be reached. If not, the Chief of Staff's office will schedule time for the PC to meet with the President for a final decision.\n\nDespite having seemingly clear and separate portfolios, the three policy councils frequently have areas of overlap, which can result in confusion, duplication, or conflict. For example, there are the areas of immigration and border security (either NSC or DPC); health care, energy, and environment (either NEC or DPC); and trade and international economic policy (either NSC or NEC). Identifying these potentially problematic areas and assigning policy responsibilities to only one council where possible will help to speed up the policy-coordination process.\n\nWhile other chapters will cover specific policy goals for each department or agency, incoming policy councils will need to move rapidly to lead policy processes around cross-cutting agency topics, including countering China, enforcing immigration laws, reversing regulatory policies in order to promote energy production, combating the Left's aggressive attacks on life and religious liberty, and confronting “wokeism” throughout the federal government.\n\n### National Security Council\n\nThe NSC is intended to be an interdepartmental body within the White House that can set national security policy with a whole-of-government approach. Unlike the other policy councils, the NSC was established by statute.8 Statutory members and advisers who are currently part of the NSC include the President and Vice President; the Secretaries of State, Defense, and Energy; the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff; and the Director of National Intelligence.\n\nThe NSC staff, and particularly the National Security Adviser, should be vetted for foreign and security policy experience and insight. The National Security Adviser and NSC staff advise the President on matters of foreign policy and national security, serve as an information conduit in times of crisis, and as liaisons ensuring that written communications are properly shared among NSC members.\n\nSpecial attention should be given to the use of detailees to staff the NSC. In recent years, the NSC's staff size has been rightsized from its peak of 400 in 2015 down to 100–150 professional members. The next Administration should try to limit the number of detailees to ensure more direct presidential control.\n\n### National Economic Council\n\nThe NEC was established in 1993 by executive order and has four key functions:\n\n- To “coordinate the economic policy-making process with respect to domestic and international economic issues.”\n- To “coordinate economic policy advice to the President.”\n- To “ensure that policy decisions and programs are consistent with the President's stated goals” and “that those goals are being effectively pursued.”\n- To “monitor implementation of the President's economic policy agenda.”\n\nThe NEC Director coordinates and implements the President's economic policy objectives by working with Cabinet secretaries, their departments, and multiple agencies. The Director is supported by a staff of policy experts in various fields, including infrastructure, manufacturing, research and development, agriculture, small business, financial regulation, housing, technology and innovation, and fiscal policy.\n\nThe NEC considers economic policy matters, and the DPC typically considers anything related to domestic matters with the exception of economic policy matters. It also differs from the Council of Economic Advisers (CEA). Whereas the NEC is in charge of policy development, the CEA acts as the White House's internal research arm for economic analysis.\n\nIt is therefore critically important to find people with the right qualifications to head both the NEC and the CEA. The CEA is almost always led by a well-known academic economist, and the NEC is regularly led by someone with expertise in directing the President's economic policy process. Those who have served in the role have ranged from former CEOs of the nation's largest investment firms to financial-services industry managers to seasoned congressional staffers who have managed the economic policy issues for top financial and tax-writing committees.\n\n### Domestic Policy Council\n\nThe Domestic Policy Council (DPC) consists of advisers to the President on noneconomic domestic policy issues as well as international issues with a significant domestic component (such as immigration). It is one of the primary policy councils serving the President along with the NSC and NEC. The Director serves as the principal DPC adviser to the President, along with members of the Cabinet, and the Deputy Director chairs the committee responsible for coordinating domestic policy development at the Deputy Secretary level.\n\nIn this respect, both the Director and the Deputy Director have critical institutional functions that affect the development of domestic policy throughout the Administration.\n\nThe DPC also has policy experts (for example, Special Assistants to the President or SAPs) who are responsible for developing and coordinating, as well as for advising the President, on specific issues. It is essential that DPC policy expertise reflect the most prominent issues that are before the Administration: issues such as the environment, health care, housing, and immigration. In addition, DPC SAPs should demonstrate a working knowledge of the rulemaking process (although they need not necessarily be experts on regulation) because a working knowledge of the rulemaking process will facilitate the DPC's effectiveness in coordinating Administration policy.\n\nThe DPC also needs to work closely with other offices within the Executive Office of the President to promote economic opportunity and private-sector innovation. This includes working with the Office of Management and Budget and its Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs as well as the Council of Economic Advisers, Council on Environmental Quality, and Office of Science and Technology Policy. To this end, the Director should chair a standing meeting with the principals from each of the other EOP offices to enhance coordination from within the White House.\n\nSeveral areas will be especially important as the DPC works to develop a well-defined domestic policy agenda. One is the promotion of innovation as a foundation for economic growth and opportunity. The President should establish an economic opportunity working group, chaired by the DPC Director, to coordinate the development of policies that promote economic opportunity. Another important area is the promotion of health care reform to bring down costs for the American people and the pressure that spending on health programs puts on the federal budget. Finally, DPC should coordinate with the NSC on a policy agenda to enhance border security.\n\n### Office of the Vice President (OVP)\n\nIn modern U.S. history, the Vice President has acted as a significant adviser to the President. Once elected, the VP helps to promote and, in many instances, put into place and execute the President's agenda. The President may additionally determine the inclusion of OVP staff in White House meetings, including Policy Coordinating Committee, Deputies Committee, and Principals Committee discussions as has been done in various recent Administrations.\n\nRecent Presidents have decided to give Vice Presidents space in the West Wing. The VP's proximity to the President—as well as to the Chief of Staff and additional senior advisers—makes his or her role a powerful one within the West Wing.\n\nPresidents typically tap VPs to lead various Administration efforts. These efforts have included serving on the NSC Principals Committee, heading the National Space Council, addressing immigration and border issues, leading the response to health care crises, and supervising workforce programs. VPs traditionally also spearhead projects of personal interest that have been authorized by the President.\n\nThe VP is also charged with breaking tie votes in the Senate and in recent years has served abroad as a brand ambassador for the White House and more broadly the United States, announcing Administration priorities and coordinating with heads of state and other top foreign government officials. The Vice President, as President of the Senate, could be a President's emissary to the Senate.\n\n### Office of the First Lady/First Gentleman\n\nThe First Lady or First Gentleman plays an interesting role in the formation, implementation, and execution of policy in concert with the President. Active and interested first spouses often champion a select number of signature issues, whether they be thorny social issues or deeper policy issues. One advantage of the first spouse's taking on hot-button social issues is that any political backlash will be less severe than it would be for the President.\n\nThe first spouse normally appoints a chief of staff who has enough assistants to support the spouse's activities in the East Wing of the White House. This group works exclusively with the first spouse and senior members of the White House along with EOP personnel to implement and execute the first spouse's priorities, which reflect the first spouse's passions and interests and are often identified as important in discussions with the President. Executed well, they can be strategically useful in accelerating the Administration's agenda. Past East Wing initiatives have focused on such issues as combating bullying, fighting drug abuse, promoting literacy, and encouraging physical education for young adults and children.\n\nThe first spouse is afforded significant resources. His or her staff also works with the President's policy team, members of the Cabinet, and other EOP staff.\n",simple:"The American presidency has always been a central part of our national identity. People are fascinated by it, as seen in movies, TV shows, and books that analyze and criticize it. The presidency represents the center of our country's power and influence. Still, nothing can replace real, firsthand experience. This guide gathers insights from people who worked in the White House, making it easy to understand and useful for future teams.\n\nTo understand the presidency, we should start with the Constitution. The Constitution gives the President “executive power,” making them the “Commander in Chief,” and requiring them to ensure that laws are followed. It also lets the President get help from top officials in each department. Since George Washington's time, every President has had a White House staff and a Cabinet made up of department heads to help them.\n\nSince the late 1700s, people have chosen to dedicate their time and skills to serving the President and helping to strengthen the country. Working in the White House Office (WHO) is now seen as a valuable tradition and one of the most challenging jobs in the government.\n\nThe President relies on the team in the WHO because they cannot do everything alone. Delegating tasks is not only helpful; it is necessary. The decisions the President's team makes affect the Administration, its reputation, and the country. Choosing people who share the President's goals is one of the most important decisions at the beginning of any Administration. This choice sets the tone and direction for the whole term.\n\n### Chief of Staff\n\nThe Chief of Staff is an Assistant to the President and is often the most important staff member for carrying out the President's vision. This person manages both the WHO staff and the Executive Office of the President (EOP).\n\nOne of the Chief of Staff's first tasks is to create an organizational chart for the WHO, showing clear lines of authority to prevent confusion. This chart includes contact points for each area of government outside the White House, including White House Liaisons chosen by the Office of Presidential Personnel (PPO).\n\nThe Chief of Staff, following the President's guidance, sets priorities for the WHO by reviewing the President's campaign promises, finding current opportunities, and assigning policy priorities to departments, agencies, and the three main policy councils:\n\n- The National Economic Council (NEC)\n- The Domestic Policy Council (DPC)\n- The National Security Council (NSC)\n\nThe Chief of Staff and senior WHO staff decide on daily and weekly issues to discuss, ensuring the President is informed by the Cabinet and senior team. The Chief works with the policy councils, the Cabinet, and the Office of Communications and Office of Legislative Affairs (OLA) to carry out policies. Senior advisers, the White House Counsel, and other counselors are also closely involved.\n\nAll senior staff report to the Chief of Staff, either directly or through two or three deputies, unless the President decides otherwise. In most cases, the Chief's direct reports include two or three deputies, the Communications Director, PPO Director, White House Counsel, and senior advisers. Sometimes, the Office of Public Liaison (OPL), the Cabinet Secretary, and Intergovernmental Affairs (IGA) report directly to the Chief, but they usually report to a Deputy Chief of Staff.\n\nThe Chief of Staff's main challenge is managing time. They must balance meetings with senior staff, guidance to the WHO, and the President's needs. An effective Chief of Staff runs the West Wing by managing relationships and influencing those around them. Choosing the right Chief is very important for the Administration.\n\n### Deputy Chiefs of Staff\n\nPresidents often appoint two Deputy Chiefs of Staff:\n\n1. **Deputy Chief of Staff for Management and Operations**\n2. **Deputy Chief of Staff for Policy**\n\nSome Administrations also have deputies who focus on other areas like strategy or planning. Occasionally, a principal Deputy Chief is appointed to guide decision-making, structure, and information flow.\n\n### Principal Deputy Chiefs of Staff\n\nNot all Chiefs of Staff appoint a principal deputy, as this can add complexity. When appointed, the principal deputy's role depends on the Chief's needs. They often handle action items themselves and pass up others to the Chief or the President, manage scheduling, and work with policy councils as directed by the Chief.\n\n- **Deputy Chief of Staff for Management and Operations**: This deputy manages the President's schedule and all logistics, such as Air Force One and ground transportation. They work closely with the Secret Service and military offices protecting the President. This deputy may also work with the NSC, Secretary of Defense, Secretary of State, and Intelligence Community for foreign trips and should have foreign policy experience.\n\n- **Deputy Chief of Staff for Policy**: This deputy oversees key roles in the WHO, often including the Office of Intergovernmental Affairs (IGA), Office of Public Liaison (OPL), and other advisory offices. For conservative Administrations, this role connects the WHO with state and local leaders, political groups, and grassroots organizations. This person should have strong policy knowledge, especially in economic, domestic, and social areas.\n\n### Senior Advisers\n\nSenior advisers are often selected for their broad experience and provide advice on political and communication issues. They might also lead specific projects or policy areas, often based on their expertise. Senior advisers usually have a close relationship with the President and give advice on both policy and communication with the public and media.\n\nIn some cases, new offices or councils are created to support senior advisers, though these may be temporary. Advisers need enough resources and clearly defined roles to work well with other teams in the White House.\n\n### Office of White House Counsel\n\nThe Office of White House Counsel offers legal advice to the President and the EOP on issues like presidential powers, ethics, and clemency. Selecting a White House Counsel is an important decision for the President. This office does not make or push policies but ensures the President's actions follow the law.\n\nAlthough the White House Counsel is not the President's personal lawyer, they should be dedicated to the President's agenda and legal boundaries. This office helps the White House follow all legal and ethical guidelines, including conflict of interest checks, financial disclosures, and training.\n\nThe Counsel's office also coordinates with the Department of Justice (DOJ) on important matters, keeping the President informed about legal challenges across the executive branch that might impact their agenda.\n\nAttorneys in this office must be able to give reliable legal guidance quickly. The President should select a Counsel who has experience in constitutional law and government processes, and who shows strong loyalty to both the President and the Constitution.\n\n### Staff Secretary\n\nThe Office of the Staff Secretary manages the flow of information in and out of the Oval Office. This position is essential in making sure the President has all the information needed to make decisions. The Staff Secretary reviews materials like memos, bills, and briefing books and ensures they are ready for the President.\n\nThe Staff Secretary also directs follow-up questions and manages the President's daily briefing book. They oversee official documents, including the President's signature.\n\n### Office of Communications\n\nThe Office of Communications, led by the Communications Director, shares the President's agenda with the public through speeches, press briefings, interviews, and social media. The office works closely with the Press Office, speechwriters, and digital teams to deliver a consistent message.\n\nThe Communications Director ensures all information aligns with the President's message. The Press Secretary acts as the President's main spokesperson, delivering messages to the public and answering media questions.\n\nThe Communications Director's job is to make sure the President's message is clear and effective, requiring political skills and a strong understanding of White House activities.\n\n### Office of Legislative Affairs (OLA)\n\nThe OLA links the White House to Congress, helping confirm presidential nominees and pass legislation. Since Congress controls federal funding, the OLA works to build support for the President's agenda.\n\nOLA has influence on congressional leaders and works to reach consensus on the President's policies. Internally, OLA staff participate in policy discussions and advise on what Congress is likely to support. Externally, they communicate with Congress to build votes for the President's priorities.\n\nOLA staff must be skilled in both policy and politics and able to communicate effectively on feasible policies.\n\n### Office of Presidential Personnel (PPO)\n\nThe PPO is responsible for staffing the executive branch. Created by President Nixon, it centralizes hiring for political roles, filling around 1,000 Senate-confirmed roles and about 3,000 political positions.\n\nThe PPO handles recruiting, background checks, and hiring recommendations. They maintain a strong connection with the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) to manage the federal workforce, focusing on strategic staffing and future leadership development.\n\n### Office of Political Affairs (OPA)\n\nThe OPA links the President with political groups, national committees, and campaigns. This office connects the White House to the President's political party, helping the Administration communicate goals to political groups and understand their concerns.\n\nSince many White House actions affect politics, the OPA works closely with other offices to consider how decisions impact the President's image.\n\n### Office of Cabinet Affairs (OCA)\n\nThe OCA coordinates communication between the White House and Cabinet. It organizes Cabinet meetings and communicates with senior staff. The Cabinet Secretary should be organized, with political or legal experience.\n\n### Office of Public Liaison (OPL)\n\nThe OPL builds coalitions and supports the President's agenda by working with social, faith-based, minority, and economic groups. The OPL, a large office, has a Director who reports to the Chief of Staff and connects with senior staff in all departments. The OPL holds listening sessions with interest groups to understand their needs.\n\nOPL staff are effective communicators, skilled at influencing others. Their roles may change as the Administration's priorities evolve.\n\n### Office of Intergovernmental Affairs (IGA)\n\nThe IGA connects the White House to state, local, and tribal governments, making sure they understand the President's agenda. The IGA collaborates with other offices, like the OPA and OPL, and has staff focused on specific regions.\n\nIGA staff need strong communication skills and the ability to work on complex political issues.\n\n### White House Policy Councils\n\nThree policy councils (NSC, NEC, and DPC) help the President manage policy across the executive branch. Each council has three main roles:\n\n- **Policy Coordination.** The councils gather input from departments to develop policies. If there are disagreements, they present options to the President.\n\n- **Policy Advice.** The council heads also act as policy advisers to the President, either coordinating opinions or helping to drive policy.\n\n- **Policy Implementation.** Councils help put policy decisions into action and oversee departments.\n\nEach council may use committees, such as:\n\n- **Policy Coordinating Committee (PCC):** Led by a Special Assistant to the President, this includes experts from relevant departments to find areas of agreement or identify disagreements.\n\n- **Deputies Committee (DC):** Chaired by the council's Deputy Assistant and attended by Deputy Secretaries, this reviews PCC recommendations, often adjusting options for further analysis.\n\n- **Principals Committee (PC):** If the DC cannot resolve a question, the council Director will lead a PC meeting with senior staff and Cabinet members before bringing issues to the President.\n\n### National Security Council\n\nThe National Security Council (NSC) is an interagency group focused on national security. Members include the President and Vice President, Secretaries of State, Defense, and Energy, and top intelligence officials. The NSC gives advice on foreign policy and national security.\n\n### National Economic Council\n\nThe National Economic Council (NEC) oversees the President's economic agenda. The NEC coordinates economic policy, advises the President, ensures policies match the President's goals, and monitors progress.\n\n### Domestic Policy Council\n\nThe Domestic Policy Council (DPC) advises the President on issues like health care, housing, and immigration. The DPC works closely with other offices to support economic opportunities and social policies and cooperates with the NSC on border security.\n\n### Office of the Vice President (OVP)\n\nThe Vice President acts as a close adviser and helps the President with the Administration's goals. The VP's office is often in the West Wing for close involvement. The VP can lead projects, break Senate tie votes, and represent the Administration abroad.\n\n### Office of the First Lady/First Gentleman\n\nThe First Lady or First Gentleman supports the President's agenda by focusing on social issues. Since the First Spouse is not an elected official, they can address sensitive topics. The First Spouse usually has a Chief of Staff and a team in the East Wing, working on projects like bullying, drug abuse, and fitness.\n",clear:"The American presidency is a central part of our country's identity and is often portrayed in movies, TV shows, and books. People see it as the heart of our nation's power and influence. However, nothing can replace firsthand experience.

Working in the White House Office (WHO) has become an important tradition and is known to be one of the most challenging jobs in government.\n\nThe President relies on the team appointed to the WHO because there is too much to manage alone. Delegating tasks is not only helpful; it is essential. The choices that the President's team makes can impact the Administration, its legacy, and the country. The President needs to pick people who will follow the same goals. This decision, made at the start of the Administration, is one of the most important choices a President will make.\n\n### Chief of Staff\n\nThe Chief of Staff is an Assistant to the President and is considered first among equals in the staff. This person is the most important staff member for making sure the President's goals are carried out. They manage both the WHO staff and the Executive Office of the President (EOP).\n\nOne of the Chief of Staff's first jobs is to create an organizational chart for the WHO, showing clear lines of authority to prevent conflicts. This chart includes points of contact for each area of government outside the White House, including White House Liaisons chosen by the Office of Presidential Personnel (PPO).\n\nThe Chief of Staff receives guidance from the President and sets priorities for the WHO. This process begins by looking at the President's campaign promises, identifying possible opportunities, and then assigning policy tasks to the departments, agencies, and the three White House policy councils:\n\n- The National Economic Council (NEC)\n- The Domestic Policy Council (DPC)\n- The National Security Council (NSC)\n\nThe Chief of Staff and senior staff plan the issues that will be discussed each day and week, while making sure that the President is fully informed by the Cabinet and senior team. The Chief of Staff works with policy councils, the Cabinet, the Office of Communications, and the Office of Legislative Affairs (OLA) to implement policies. Senior advisers, the White House Counsel, and other senior staff members are also involved.\n\nThe Chief of Staff has to manage time carefully. They need to balance meetings and directions to the WHO with the President's needs. The Chief's use of deputies and influence over the West Wing staff can make the Administration run smoothly, which makes selecting the right person for Chief of Staff crucial.\n\n### Deputy Chiefs of Staff\n\nPresidents usually appoint two Deputy Chiefs of Staff:\n\n1. **Deputy Chief of Staff for Management and Operations**\n2. **Deputy Chief of Staff for Policy**\n\nSome Administrations have also appointed deputies to handle other areas like strategy or planning. Sometimes, a principal Deputy Chief is chosen to guide decision-making, structure, and information flow.\n\n### Principal Deputy Chiefs of Staff\n\nNot all Chiefs of Staff have a principal deputy, as this can add complexity. However, when a principal deputy is appointed, their role varies based on the Chief of Staff's needs. Principal deputies often manage specific tasks, address issues they can handle alone, and bring higher-priority items to the Chief of Staff or President. They also manage scheduling and work with policy councils as directed by the Chief of Staff.\n\n- **Deputy Chief of Staff for Management and Operations**: This deputy handles the President's schedule and logistics, such as travel on Air Force One and ground transportation. They coordinate closely with the Secret Service and the military offices that protect the President. This deputy may also work with the NSC, Secretary of Defense, Secretary of State, and Intelligence Community on international travel, and they should be familiar with foreign policy.\n\n- **Deputy Chief of Staff for Policy**: This deputy leads areas like the IGA, OPA, and OPL. For conservative Administrations, they connect the WHO with state and local leaders, political organizations, and grassroots groups. This deputy should have strong policy knowledge in economic, domestic, and social areas.\n\n### Senior Advisers\n\nSenior advisers are often chosen to provide a wide range of advice, including guidance on politics and communication. Senior advisers might also manage specific projects or policy areas, often based on their expertise. Many senior advisers have a close relationship with the President and give input on both policy and communication with the public.\n\nSome Administrations create special offices or councils to support senior advisers, although these can be temporary. Senior advisers need to have enough staff and resources to be effective, and their roles should be clearly defined to ensure they work well with other White House teams.\n\n### Office of White House Counsel\n\nThe Office of White House Counsel gives the President and EOP legal advice on issues like presidential powers, ethics, and clemency. Choosing a White House Counsel is an important decision for any President. This office does not make or push policies but makes sure the President's actions follow the law.\n\nAlthough the White House Counsel is not the President's personal lawyer, the Counsel should have a strong commitment to the President's agenda and to working within legal limits. This office also helps the White House follow legal and ethical guidelines, including financial disclosures, conflict of interest checks, and training.\n\nThe White House Counsel's office also works closely with the Department of Justice (DOJ), coordinating important legal matters and keeping the President informed about legal challenges that might affect their agenda.\n\nAttorneys in this office must be able to give quick, reliable legal guidance. The President should choose a Counsel who has broad experience in areas like constitutional law and government processes, as well as a strong loyalty to the President and the Constitution.\n\n### Staff Secretary\n\nThe Office of the Staff Secretary is responsible for managing the information that goes in and out of the Oval Office.

The Press Secretary serves as the President's main spokesperson, delivering messages to the public and responding to media questions.\n\nThe Communications Director's job is to make sure the President's message is clear and effective. This role requires political skill and a deep understanding of what is happening in the White House.\n\n### Office of Legislative Affairs (OLA)\n\nThe OLA is the link between the White House and Congress, helping to confirm nominees and pass legislation. Since Congress controls federal funding, the OLA works to maintain support in the legislature for the President's agenda.\n\nThe OLA works directly with congressional leaders and mediates to build consensus for the President's policies. Internally, OLA staff participate in policy discussions and advise on what Congress is likely to support. Externally, they communicate with Congress to gather votes for the President's priorities.\n\nThe OLA team needs to be skilled in both policy and politics, able to communicate effectively about what policies are possible. This office must work as a united team to support the President's agenda.\n\n### Office of Presidential Personnel (PPO)\n\nThe phrase “personnel is policy” reflects the importance of the PPO in handling political appointments. Created by President Nixon, the PPO centralizes hiring for political roles, filling around 1,000 Senate-confirmed roles and about 3,000 additional positions.\n\nThe PPO recruits and evaluates candidates, conducts background checks, makes recommendations, and ensures a strong relationship with the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) for handling the federal workforce.

The President must set and enforce a plan for the executive branch. Sadly, however, a President today assumes office to find a sprawling federal bureaucracy that all too often is carrying out its own policy plans and preferences—or, worse yet, the policy plans and preferences of a radical, supposedly “woke” faction of the country.\n\nThe modern conservative President's task is to limit, control, and direct the executive branch on behalf of the American people. This challenge is created and exacerbated by factors like Congress's decades-long tendency to delegate its lawmaking power to agency bureaucracies, the pervasive notion of expert “independence” that protects so-called expert authorities from scrutiny, the presumed inability to hold career civil servants accountable for their performance, and the increasing reality that many agencies are not only too big and powerful, but also increasingly weaponized against the public and a President who is elected by the people and empowered by the Constitution to govern.\n\nIn *Federalist No. 47*, James Madison warned that “[t]he accumulation of all powers, legislative, executive, and judiciary, in the same hands, whether of one, a few, or many, and whether hereditary, self-appointed, or elective, may justly be pronounced the very definition of tyranny.”[^2] Regrettably, that wise and cautionary note describes to a significant degree the modern executive branch, which—whether controlled by the bureaucracy or by the President—writes federal policy, enforces that policy, and often adjudicates whether that policy was properly drafted and enforced. The overall situation is constitutionally dire, unsustainably expensive, and in urgent need of repair. Nothing less than the survival of self-governance in America is at stake.\n\nThe great challenge confronting a conservative President is the existential need for aggressive use of the vast powers of the executive branch to return power—including power currently held by the executive branch—to the American people. Success in meeting that challenge will require a rare combination of boldness and self-denial: boldness to bend or break the bureaucracy to the presidential will and self-denial to use the bureaucratic machine to send power away from Washington and back to America's families, faith communities, local governments, and states.\n\nFortunately, a President who is willing to lead will find in the Executive Office of the President (EOP) the levers necessary to reverse this trend and impose a sound direction for the nation on the federal bureaucracy. The effectiveness of those EOP levers depends on the fundamental premise that it is the President's agenda that should matter to the departments and agencies that operate under his constitutional authority and that, as a general matter, it is the President's chosen advisers who have the best sense of the President's aims and intentions, both with respect to the policies he intends to enact and with respect to the interests that must be secured to govern successfully on behalf of the American people. This chapter focuses on key features of and recommendations for several of the EOP's important components.\n\n## U.S. Office of Management and Budget (OMB)\n\nOMB assists the President in the execution of his policy agenda across the government by employing many statutory and executive procedural levers to bring the bureaucracy in line with all budgetary, regulatory, and management decisions. Properly understood, it is a President's air-traffic control system with the ability and charge to ensure that all policy initiatives are flying in sync and with the authority to let planes take off and, at times, ground planes that are flying off course.\n\nOMB's key roles include:\n\n- Developing and enforcing the President's budget and executing the appropriations laws that fund the government;\n- Managing agency and personnel performance, procurement policy, financial management, and information technology;\n- Developing the President's regulatory agenda, reviewing new regulatory actions, reviewing federal information collections, and setting and enforcing federal information policy; and\n- Coordinating and clearing agency communications with Congress, including testimonies and views on draft legislation.\n\nOMB cannot perform its role on behalf of the President effectively if it is not intimately involved in all aspects of the White House policy process and lacks knowledge of what the agencies are doing. Internally to the EOP, ensuring that the policy-formulation procedures developed by the White House to serve the President include OMB is one of any OMB Director's major responsibilities. A common meme of those who intend to evade OMB review is to argue that where “resources” are not being discussed, OMB's participation is optional. This ignores both OMB's role in all downstream execution and the reality that it has the only statutory tools in the White House that are powerful enough to override implementing agencies' bureaucracies.\n\nThe Director must view his job as the best, most comprehensive approximation of the President's mind as it pertains to the policy agenda while always being ready with actual options to effect that agenda within existing legal authorities and resources. This role cannot be performed adequately if the Director acts instead as the ambassador of the institutional interests of OMB and the wider bureaucracy to the White House. Once its reputation as the keeper of “commander's intent” is established, then and only then does OMB have the ability to shape the most efficient way to pursue an objective.\n\nExternally, the Director must ensure that OMB has sufficient visibility into the deep caverns of agency decision-making. One indispensable statutory tool to that end is to ensure that policy officials—the Program Associate Directors (PADs) managing the vast Resource Management Offices (RMOs)—personally sign what are known as the apportionments. In 1870, Congress passed the Anti-Deficiency Act[^3] to prevent the common agency practice of spending down all appropriated funding, creating artificial funding shortfalls that Congress would have to fill. The law mandated that all funding be allotted or “apportioned” in installments. This process, whereby agencies come to OMB for allotments of appropriated funding, is essential to the effective financial stewardship of taxpayer dollars. OMB can then direct on behalf of a President the amount, duration, and purpose of any apportioned funding to ensure against waste, fraud, and abuse and ensure consistency with the President's agenda and applicable laws.\n\nThe vast majority of these apportionments were signed by career officials—the Deputy Associate Directors (DADs)—until the Trump Administration placed this responsibility in the hands of the PADs and thereby opened wide vistas of oversight that had escaped the attention of policy officials. The Biden Administration subsequently reversed this decision. No Director should be chosen who is unwilling to restore apportionment decision-making to the PADs' personal review, who is not aggressive in wielding the tool on behalf of the President's agenda, or who is unable to defend the power against attacks from Congress.\n\nIt should be noted that each of OMB's primary functions, along with other executive and statutory roles, is carried out with the help of many essential OMB support offices. The two most important offices for moving OMB at the will of a Director are the Budget Review Division (BRD) and the Office of General Counsel (OGC). The Director should have a direct and effective relationship with the head of the BRD (considered the top career official within OMB) and transmit most instructions through that office because the rest of the agency is institutionally inclined toward its direction and responds accordingly. The BRD inevitably will translate the directions from policy officials to the career staff, and at every stage, it is obviously vital that the Director ensure that this translation is an accurate one.\n\nIn addition, many key considerations involved in enacting a President's agenda hinge on existing legal authorities. The Director must ensure the appointment of a General Counsel who is respected yet creative and fearless in his or her ability to challenge legal precedents that serve to protect the status quo. This is vital within OMB not only with respect to the adequate development of policy options for the President's review, but also with respect to agencies that attempt to protect their own institutional interests and foreclose certain avenues based on the mere assertion (and not proof) that the law disallows it or that, conversely, attempt to disregard the clear statutory commands of Congress.\n\nIn general, the Director should empower a strong Deputy Director with authority over the Deputy for Management, the PADs, and the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs (OIRA) to work diligently to break down barriers within OMB and not allow turf disputes or a lack of visibility to undermine the agency's principal budget, management, and regulatory functions. OMB should work toward a “One OMB” position on behalf of the President and represent that view during the various policymaking processes.\n\n### Budget\n\nThe United States today faces an untenable fiscal situation and owes $31 trillion on a debt that is steadily increasing. The OMB Director should present a fiscal goal to the President early in the budget development process to address the federal government's fiscal irresponsibility. This goal would help to align the months-long process of developing the actual proposals for inclusion in the budget. Though some mistakenly regard it as a mere paper-pushing exercise, the President's budget is in fact a powerful mechanism for setting and enforcing public policy at federal agencies. The budget team includes six Resource Management Offices that, together with the BRD and other components, help the Director of OMB to develop and execute detailed agency spending plans that bear on every major aspect of policy formation and execution at federal agencies. Through initial priority-setting and ongoing supervision of agency spending, OMB's budget team plays a key role in executing policy across the executive branch, including at many agencies wrongly regarded as “independent.”\n\nThe RMOs, each of which is led by a political appointee known as the PAD and a career DAD, are separated into six functional units:\n\n- National Security.\n- Natural Resources, Energy, and Science.\n- Health.\n- Education, Income Maintenance, and Labor.\n- Transportation, Justice, and Homeland Security.\n- Treasury, Commerce, and Housing.\n\nBecause the RMOs are institutionally ingrained in nearly all policymaking and implementation across the executive branch, they play a critical role in helping the Director to implement the President's public policy agenda. However, because each RMO is responsible for formulating and supervising such a wide range of policy details, many granular but critical policy decisions are effectively left to the career professionals who serve across Administrations.\n\nTo enhance the OMB Director's ability to help the President drive policy at the agencies, the existing six RMOs should be divided into smaller subject-matter areas, allowing for more PADs, and each of these PADs should have a Deputy PAD. This expanded pool of RMOs with additional political leadership would enable more comprehensive direction and oversight of policy development and implementation.\n\nRegardless of whether Congress adopts the President's full set of budget recommendations, the President should reintroduce the concept of administrative pay-as-you-go, or administrative PAYGO. This simple procedural requirement imposes budget neutrality on the discretionary choices of federal agencies, of which there are many in nearly all areas of policymaking. This simple step forces the executive branch to control what it can control. The principle may occasionally yield to other overarching requirements, such as a presidential regulatory budget, but in nearly all cases, administrative PAYGO plays a unique and indispensable role in enforcing fiscal responsibility at federal departments and agencies.\n\nThe President should use every possible tool to propose and impose fiscal discipline on the federal government. Anything short of that would constitute abject failure.\n\n### Management\n\nThe Management Office of OMB (the “M-Side” as it is often called) is responsible for carrying out several important agency oversight functions, many of which are statutory. The Management team includes the following offices led by presidentially appointed Senate-confirmed individuals:\n\n- The Office of Federal Procurement Policy (OFPP).\n- The Office of Performance and Personnel Management (OPPM).\n- The Office of Federal Financial Management (OFFM).\n- The Office of the Federal Chief Information Officer (OFCIO).\n- The Made in America Office (MIAO), which was added by the Biden Administration and is not a Senate-confirmed slot.\n\nEach of these offices has responsibilities and authorities that a President can use to help drive policy across the government. It is vital that the Director and his political staff, not the careerists, drive these offices in pursuit of the President's actual priorities and not let them set their own agenda based on the wishes of the sprawling “good government” management community in and outside of government. Many Directors do not properly prioritize the management portfolio, leaving it to the Deputy for Management, but such neglect creates purposeless bureaucracy that impedes a President's agenda—an “M Train to Nowhere.”\n\n**OFPP.** This office plays a critical role in leading the development of new policies and regulations concerning federal contracting and procurement. Through the Federal Acquisition Regulatory Council, which is generally chaired by the OFPP Administrator, OFPP helps the Director to set a wide range of policies for all of those who contract with the executive branch. In the past, those governmentwide contracting rules have played a key role in helping to implement the President's policy agenda. This office should be engaged early and often in OMB's effort to drive policy, including by obtaining transparency about entities that are awarded federal contracts and grants and by using government contracts to push back against woke policies in corporate America.\n\n**OPPM.** Through this office, the Director helps federal agencies to establish their performance goals and performance review processes. OPPM also works with the U.S. Office of Personnel Management (OPM) to establish and manage personnel policies and practices across the federal government. The Director should instruct OPPM to establish annual performance goals and review processes for agencies that reflect the President's agenda. OPPM should also be part of the President's strategy to set and enforce sensible policies and practices for the federal workforce.\n\n**OFFM.** This office helps the Director to root out waste, fraud, and abuse in federal programs—for example, through the Do Not Pay program. It should be part of efforts to save precious taxpayer resources.\n\n**OFCIO.** This office guides the federal government's use and adoption of Internet-based technologies to improve government operations and save taxpayer money. As a function of its leadership role, it is critical in interagency discussions on a wide range of technology issues. The office thus is an important part of the President's efforts to modernize, strengthen, and set technology-adoption policy for the executive branch.\n\n**MIAO.** Building on the example and work of the Trump Administration, President Biden established this office to centralize, carry out, and further develop the federal government's Buy-American and other Made-in-America commitments. Its work ought to be continued and further strengthened.\n\n### Regulatory and Information Policy\n\nOMB's Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs (OIRA) plays an enormous and vital role in reining in the regulatory state and ensuring that regulations achieve important benefits while imposing minimal burdens on Americans. The President should maintain Executive Order (EO) 12866, the foundation of OIRA's review of regulatory actions. The Administration should likewise maintain the recent extension of those standards to regulatory actions of the U.S. Department of the Treasury. Regulatory analysis and OIRA review should also be required of the historically “independent” agencies, as the Office of Legal Counsel has found legally permissible.\n\nIf the current Administration proceeds with its declared intent to modify aspects of EO 12866 or review OMB Circular A-4, the related document that provides the foundation for cost-benefit analysis, the next President should immediately begin to undo those changes and develop a rigorous, data-driven approach that will result in the least burdensome rules possible. The next President should also revive the directive in Executive Order 13891, which mandates that significant guidance documents must pass through OIRA review.\n\nBecause OIRA review often leads to fewer regulatory burdens, more regulatory benefits, and better coordination of regulatory policy, funding for OIRA tends to pay large dividends. Yet over the years, funding for OIRA has diminished. This trend should be reversed. The budget should also include sufficient full-time equivalent (FTE) employees to form regulatory advance teams that would consult with agencies on cost-benefit analysis and good regulatory practices at the beginning of the rulemaking process for the most important regulations. These teams would help agencies take cost-benefit analysis into account from the beginning of their rulemaking efforts, resulting in higher-quality regulations and a swifter eventual OIRA review. To preserve the integrity of OIRA review, the staff who consult at the beginning of a rulemaking should not handle its eventual review.\n\nThe next President should also reinstate the many executive orders signed by President Trump that were designed to make the regulatory process more just, efficient, and transparent. Executive Orders 13771, 13777, 13891, 13892, 13893, 13924 (Section 6), 13979, and 13980 should be revived (with modifications as needed). Executive Order 13132 on federalism should be strengthened so that state regulatory and fiscal operations are not commandeered by the federal government through so-called cooperative federalism programs. Additionally, the President should revise and sign an updated version of President Ronald Reagan's Executive Order 12630 on federal takings.\n\nThe next President should strengthen the implementation of the Information Quality Act, robustly use the authority of the Paperwork Reduction Act, carefully enforce the Privacy Act, and ensure the sound execution of OIRA's statistical and other information policy functions. Regulatory cooperation agreements can also promote the further adoption of good regulatory practices, which improve market conditions for America and her allies. OIRA should also work with other components of OMB to revise and apply OMB's uniform Guidance for Grants and Agreements and ensure that federal contract and grant guidelines satisfy EO 12866 and other centralized standards as appropriate.\n\nBut executive reforms and actions, while vital, are not enough: Congress also must act. The next President should work with Congress to pass significant regulatory policy and process reforms, which could go a long way toward reining in the administrative state. Excellent examples of such legislation include the Regulatory Accountability Act, SMART Act, GOOD Act, Early Participation in Regulations Act, Unfunded Mandates Accountability and Transparency Act, and REINS Act.\n\nFinally, the next President should work with Congress to maximize the utility of the Congressional Review Act (CRA), which allows Congress to undo midnight regulatory actions (including those disguised as “guidance”) on an accelerated timeline. To leverage the CRA's power to the maximum extent, Congress and the President should enact the Midnight Rules Relief Act, which would help to ensure that multiple regulatory actions could be packaged and voted on at the same time. Immediate and robust use of the CRA would allow the President to focus his rulemaking resources on major new regulatory reforms rather than devoting months or years to undoing the final rulemakings of the Biden Administration.\n\n### Legislative Clearance and Coordination\n\nOMB plays a critical role in ensuring that the executive branch is aligned on legislative proposals and language, agency testimonies, and other communications with Congress. The Director should use these authorities to enforce policy and message consistency aggressively and promote the effective engagement of the executive branch in legislative processes.\n\n### National Security Council (NSC)\n\nThe National Security Council (NSC) was established by statute to support the President in developing and implementing national security policy by coordinating across relevant departments and agencies, integrating authorities and resources toward common ends, and objectively assessing progress toward established goals. Led by the National Security Advisor (NSA), the NSC staff will be successful in implementing the President's national security goals only if it is made up of personnel with technical expertise and experience as well as an alignment to the President's declared national security policy priorities. The NSC must then chart a course that articulates and achieves the President's national security goals and objectives. The President should empower a strong NSC that not only has the power to convene the policy process, but also is entrusted with the full power of the presidency to drive the bureaucracy.\n\nIn organizing (by means of Presidential Directive) an NSC staff that is more responsive and aligned with the President's goals and empowered to implement them, the NSA should immediately evaluate and eliminate directorates that are not aligned with the President's agenda and replace them with new directorates as appropriate that can drive implementation of the President's signature national security priorities. In addition to realigning the staff organization to the President's priorities, the NSA should assign responsibility for the implementation of specific policy initiatives to senior NSC officials from across the NSC staff structure. These officials should develop, direct, and execute tangible action plans in coordination with multiple agencies to achieve measurable, time-defined milestones.\n\nAligning NSC staff to the President's national security goals will provide clearer direction, a mandate for action, and a baseline of accountability that can be used to evaluate staff performance and the NSC's overall progress. Accountable senior officials, themselves either political appointees or a minimum number of career detailees, who are selected and vetted politically and report directly to political staff should be the main day-to-day managers for interagency coordination and implementation of their assigned national security policy objectives. They should provide policy analysis for consideration by the broader NSC and relevant agencies and ensure timely responses to decisions made by the President. The accountable senior officials should be established at the direction of the NSA and draw on personnel and expertise from beyond the NSC, including OMB, the National Economic Council, and relevant federal agencies.\n\nThe NSC staff and principals should work in tandem with the National Economic Council and OMB at all levels, presenting a united effort to achieve the President's goals and drawing on the latter's statutory authorities to guide the bureaucracy. To accomplish national objectives effectively, foreign policy should fully incorporate the economic instruments of national power. National security policy must also include the prioritized allocation of resources. When policies are divorced from the resources required to implement them, they are stillborn—academic exercises that undermine our national security and leave departments and agencies to their own devices.\n\nThe accountable senior officials should be empowered to identify, recruit, clear, and hire staff who are aligned with and willing to shepherd the President's national security priorities. NSC staff leads, under the direction of the NSA, should have the discretion to reduce the number of positions that need high-level clearances, and the NSC should be adequately resourced and authorized to adjudicate and hold security clearances internally with investigators who work directly for the NSC and whose sole task is to clear NSC officials. If certain staff are determined not to need high-level clearances, the question becomes whether they should be part of the NSC at all.\n\nThe NSC should take a leading role in directing the drafting and thorough review of all formal strategies: the National Security Strategy, the National Defense Strategy, the Nuclear Posture Review, the Missile Defense Strategy, etc. In particular, the National Defense Strategy, which by tradition has evaded significant review, should be prioritized for White House review by the NSC and OMB. Both should also conduct reviews of operational war plans and global force planning and allocations with the Secretary of Defense to align them with presidential priorities and review all key policy and guidance intended for implementation by the heads of the Department of Defense, the Department of State, and the Intelligence Community before they are authorized for distribution. The NSC should rigorously review all general and flag officer promotions to prioritize the core roles and responsibilities of the military over social engineering and non-defense matters, including climate change, critical race theory, manufactured extremism, and other polarizing policies that weaken our armed forces and discourage our nation's finest men and women from enlisting to serve in defense of our liberty.\n\nThe NSC staff will need to consolidate the functions of both the NSC and the Homeland Security Council (HSC), incorporate the recently established Office of the National Cyber Director, and evaluate the required regional and functional directorates. Given the aforementioned prerequisites, the NSC should be properly resourced with sufficient policy professionals, and the NSA should prioritize staffing the vast majority of NSC directorates with aligned political appointees and trusted career officials. For instance, the NSA should return all nonessential detailees to their home agencies on their first day in office so that the new Administration can proceed efficiently without the personnel land mines left by the previous stewards and as soon as possible should replace all essential detailees with staff aligned to the new President's priorities. The HSC has overseen pandemic response, and its incorporation is important.\n\nIn the end, change requires intervention, and the NSC staff should be appropriately recruited, manned, and empowered to achieve the President's national security and foreign policy objectives and maintain robust policy analysis and discussion while minimizing resistance from those who have an agenda or who jealously guard their resources and autonomy at the expense of national security and sound policy development. This resistance and inertia can be inadvertently enabled by a small and unempowered NSC.\n\nAdditionally, the White House Chief of Staff and NSA must ensure that the NSC is functioning in tandem with the rest of the White House staff to benefit from the best strategic thinking of the President's top advisers. History shows that an unsupervised NSC staff can stray from its statutory role and adversely affect a President and his policies. Moreover, while the NSC should be fully incorporated into the White House, it should also be allowed to do its job without the impediment of dually hatted staff that report to other offices. For instance, the NSC needs its own counsel to inform what legal options can be provided to the President. The White House Counsel should be part of that policy process as the President's top legal adviser. These recommendations provide a clear road map for rapidly sizing and solidifying the NSC staff to support and achieve the President's objectives beginning on Inauguration Day.\n\n### NATIONAL ECONOMIC COUNCIL (NEC)\n\nThe National Economic Council is one of the policy councils serving the President along with the NSC and the Domestic Policy Council (DPC). The Director serves as principal adviser to the President on domestic and international economic policy and communicates the President's economic message to the media. The Deputy Director is responsible for the day-to-day operation of the council, which includes chairing the committee that coordinates economic policy development at the Deputy Secretary level. In effect, the Director and Deputy Director are the officials who are primarily responsible for the development of economic policymaking for the Administration. Once a policy is adopted, it is the appropriate agency's responsibility to implement it. The NEC's policy process is also used to determine whether the President should support or oppose legislation passed by Congress.\n\nIn addition to its leadership, the NEC has policy experts (for example, Special Assistants to the President or SAPs) who are responsible for developing and coordinating, as well as advising the President, on specific issues. It is essential that the policy expertise of the NEC reflect the current environment's most pressing issues. Today, this would include (among other topics) taxes, energy and environment, technology, infrastructure, health care, financial services, workforce, agriculture, antitrust and competition policy, and retirement programs. NEC's SAPs should have a working knowledge of how the Administration can implement policy through the rulemaking process, although it is not necessary that they be experts on regulation themselves, particularly given OMB's role. This will facilitate the NEC's effectiveness in coordinating Administration policy.\n\nThe NEC needs to work closely with other offices within the Executive Office of the President to promote innovation by the private sector and create an environment that will stimulate economic activity while reducing federal spending and debt. This includes working with the DPC, NSC, OMB, Council of Economic Advisers, Office of Intergovernmental Affairs, Office of Cabinet Affairs, White House Counsel, Council on Environmental Quality, Office of Legislative Affairs, and Office of Science and Technology Policy. To this end, the NEC Director should chair a standing meeting with the principals from each of the other EOP offices to enhance coordination from within the White House.\n\nIn the past, there has been tension among the DPC, NEC, and NSC over jurisdiction. It is important to set clear jurisdictions at the start of an Administration to prevent needless and counterproductive turf fights. In addition, the Principal Deputy for international economic policy is jointly appointed at NEC and NSC and could end up serving two different interests. To avoid such problems, international economic policy should be entirely coordinated from NEC.\n\nIt will be especially important for the NEC to work seamlessly with the Council of Economic Advisers (CEA), which provides the President and the White House offices with the latest economic data and forecasts, as well as estimates of the economic impact of proposed policies, and prepares the annual Economic Report of the President. The CEA is not a policy council and therefore does not run policy processes, which is the responsibility of the NEC, DPC, and NSC. However, the CEA does play a key role in ensuring that any policy considered by the councils is rigorously evaluated for its economic impacts.\n\nThe NEC works closely with the White House Office of Communications and Office of Speechwriting to ensure that the White House's messaging and media engagement communicate the President's economic policy effectively.\n\nThe NEC also plays a key role in advancing the President's economic agenda by advising the Office of Presidential Personnel on appointments to key economic posts, including positions in financial regulatory agencies. The NEC helps to ensure that each economic post is held by a person who shares the President's policy priorities and works well with the rest of the Administration's economic team. The financial regulators are run partly by civil servants (some of whom were political appointees in prior liberal Administrations) who often resist a conservative Administration's policies. It is therefore critical that an Administration not only appoints capable individuals to lead these agencies, but also has personnel who can be hired into senior staff positions within the agencies.\n\nA few areas will be especially important if the NEC is to develop a well-defined economic policy agenda. One is the promotion of innovation as a foundation for economic growth and opportunity. Another is the creation of an environment that fosters economic growth through tax reform and the elimination of regulatory and procedural barriers.\n\n### OFFICE OF THE U.S. TRADE REPRESENTATIVE (USTR)\n\nThe Office of the U.S. Trade Representative provides the President with the internal White House resources necessary to formulate and execute a unified, whole-of-government approach to trade policy. The President should ensure that the USTR is empowered to serve in that leadership role, much as other EOP components organize and drive a coordinated policy agenda on behalf of the President.\n\nThe People's Republic of China's predatory trade practices have disrupted the open-market trading system that has provided mutual benefit to all participating countries—including China—for decades. The failure of the World Trade Organization (WTO) to discipline China for abrogation of its trading commitments has seriously undermined its credibility and made it a largely ineffective institution. The United States, through an empowered USTR, must act to rebalance and refocus international trading relationships in favor of democratic nations that embrace free, fair, and open trade principles built on market-driven economies.\n\nChapter 26 of this book outlines recommended trade policy priorities for the incoming President. However, regardless of the approach, successful implementation of that trade agenda will require the President to articulate a clear policy direction and instructions for the executive branch to operate in a coordinated fashion under the leadership of an empowered USTR.\n\nTo address these and other challenges, protect the American worker, and secure free and open markets for our communities and businesses, the next President must leverage the institutional resources and strength of the USTR and neither allow institutional interests to drive a fragmented trade policy that is developed from the ground up nor cater to parochial interests across government and Washington's broader industry of influence.\n\nThe USTR's mission is vitally important in reorienting the global trading system in a direction that is open, fair, and prosperous. In order to achieve the President's policy goals, a strong USTR must be empowered to set trade policy from the White House with the authority and resources to represent the interests of the President's trade agenda with adequate budget, staff, analysis, and expertise to engage meaningfully in internal and interagency policy deliberations. The USTR should organize and harness existing interagency trade committees to serve the President's trade agenda and drive a consensus among federal stakeholders, dispose of legacy advisory committees with members who serve special interests, direct action to implement policy priorities, measure progress toward implementing the President's agenda, and hold agencies and officials accountable for delivering the President's agenda. The USTR's leadership should not only coordinate and enforce the President's agenda across the federal community, but also set and enforce the President's trade agenda internally.\n\nTrade policy and priorities should be set by the President and implemented by the U.S. Trade Representative in cooperation with the other economic and national security officials, not by the range of governmental and nongovernmental interests that attempt to force their policy preferences on the USTR. A strong USTR empowered with the necessary resources, authorities, and interagency cooperation will protect U.S. interests in the global marketplace more effectively.\n\n### COUNCIL OF ECONOMIC ADVISERS (CEA)\n\nCongress established the Council of Economic Advisers in 1946 to advise the President on economic policy based on data, research, and evidence. The CEA is one of the oldest congressionally created offices within the White House complex and plays a broad role in bringing economic expertise to Administration policy across a large range of policy areas. The CEA has one presidentially appointed and Senate-confirmed chair, two presidentially appointed members who assist and often have expertise that complements the chair, and approximately 40 staff employees.\n\nStatutorily, the CEA is charged with being the President's principal source of economic advice. However, this role has diminished over time as its policy appraisal and especially formulation and recommendation functions have been taken over or diluted by other economic policy bodies within the White House. By law, the CEA is required to publish an annual Economic Report of the President within 10 days after submission of the budget. This report is not just a messaging document; it is an opportunity to provide greater rigor in support of policy areas that the White House is prioritizing and to build up the external credibility of those ideas.\n\nA future conservative Administration should utilize the CEA as the senior internal White House economists much as the White House Counsel's office functions as the senior internal White House lawyers. This does not mean that there are no economists in other offices. There are, just as there often are lawyers in the policy councils and other White House offices, but the CEA's role, like the White House Counsel's, is to employ its unique expertise (particularly on the technical side) to ensure that sound analysis is contributing to and shaping the policy discussion.\n\nIn practice, this means that CEA staff do not “coordinate” the policy process in the way that the DPC or NEC would, but they should be integral to the EOP's policy development processes. CEA staff should support sound policy development and execution by actively contributing to running policy dialogues, proactively raising issues that need to be addressed, consulting on questions that arise, and guiding EOP and agency officials on the analytical foundations of policy. Structurally, the White House Chief of Staff should ensure that the CEA has a seat at the policymaking table on all relevant policy.\n\nSenior economists traditionally have not gone through the Office of Presidential Personnel process and more often than not are hired on an academic-year cycle. As a result, senior economists hired in the summer of a presidential election year tend to remain on staff until the next summer even if a President from the opposite party takes power and installs a new slate of CEA political appointees for chair, members, etc. Although these hiring practices create some continuity, the presence of senior economists who were never fully vetted for their alignment with White House policy objectives or who were holdovers from a recently departed Administration can breed skepticism and distrust of the CEA by other units within the White House, creating the risk that the CEA's role in the policymaking process will be diminished. A future Administration should consider hiring that reflects the White House calendar (mid-January) and involves the Office of Presidential Personnel.\n\n### NATIONAL SPACE COUNCIL (NSPC)\n\nThe National Space Council is responsible for providing advice and recommendations to the President on the formulation and implementation of space policy and strategy. It is charged with conducting a whole-of-government approach to the nation's space interests: civil, military, intelligence, commercial, or diplomatic. Historically, it has been chaired by the Vice President at the President's direction, and its members consist of members of the Cabinet and other senior executive branch officials as specified by the President in Executive Order 13803. The NSPC's purpose is to ensure that the President's priorities relative to space are carried out and, as necessary, to resolve policy conflicts among departments and agencies that are related to space.\n\nSpace projects and programs are risky, complex, expensive, and time consuming—although commercial space innovations are lowering costs and accelerating schedules. Nevertheless, while fiscal discipline should not be ignored, long-term policy stability is crucial to investors, innovators, industry, and agencies. Policy stability is easier when policies and programs are aligned with long-term national interests as opposed to those of particular advocacy groups or political factions. The Trump Administration's major space policies—including the U.S. Space Force, the Artemis program to land the next Americans on the moon, and support for a strong commercial space sector—have endured under the Biden Administration.\n\nMajor challenges remain in implementation and regulatory reform to keep up with rapidly evolving space markets and competitors. These include the long-term sustainability of space activities in light of increasing orbital debris; creation of space situational awareness services for civil and commercial uses; management of mega-constellations; licensing of new commercial remote sensing capabilities; keeping up with licensing demands due to high launch rates; transitioning International Space Station operations to multiple, privately owned space platforms; and (most important) accelerating the acquisition and fielding of national security space capabilities in response to an increasingly aggressive China.\n\nThe Vice President should have a clear understanding with the National Security Advisor and the White House Counsel that they and their respective staffs will work within the White House to determine the scope and leadership of policy reviews that can overlap multiple areas of responsibility. A similar understanding is necessary with the heads of other policy councils such as the NEC, DPC, and National Science and Technology Council (NSTC).\n\nAs a result of the President's direction and the Vice President's leadership, the NSPC under the Trump Administration was able to coordinate a wide range of space policy reviews, legislative proposals, and regulatory reforms smoothly. The NSPC generally led on space issues within the EOP, but other White House offices also took on space topics.\n\n- As a member of the NSPC, and in coordination with other members, the Office of Science and Technology Policy developed a national space weather strategy, research and development (R&D) plans to mitigate the effects of orbital debris, and protocols for planetary protection to avoid biological contamination of celestial bodies.\n- The Council of Economic Advisers did research on the economic benefits of space property rights.\n- OMB's Office of Information and Regulatory Reform updated and streamlined commercial launch licensing and commercial remote sensing satellite rules.\n\nDuring the Trump Administration, if a topic was purely military, such as standing up the U.S. Space Command, the NSC took the lead. If a topic cut across military, civil, and commercial sectors, as was the case with cybersecurity in space, the NSPC and NSC would cochair the policy review groups.\n\nTrusted, collegial relationships across the White House complex are critical to successful space policy development, implementation, and oversight. Nowhere is this more important than in the relationship between the NSPC staff and OMB staff who oversee civil and national security–related space spending. Teamwork between the NSPC and OMB staff can communicate clear presidential priorities to departments and agencies, facilitating smooth development of the President's budget request. The NSPC and OMB have many opportunities to collaborate in promoting presidential priorities while finding offsets in lower-priority programs and funding lines.\n\n### OFFICE OF SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY POLICY (OSTP)\n\nThe White House Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP) was created by the National Science and Technology Policy, Organization, and Priorities Act of 1976. Before its creation, Presidents received their advice and counsel on such matters through advisers and boards that had no statutory authority. The Director of OSTP is one of the few Senate-confirmed positions within the Executive Office of the President. Consistent with other laws, the President may delegate to the Director of OSTP directive authority over other elements of the executive branch. Other EOP policy officials and organizations such as the NSC and NEC are formally only advisory with relevant agency directives issued by the President.\n\nThe OSTP's functions, as contained in the law, are to advise the President of scientific and technological considerations, evaluate the effectiveness of the federal effort, and generally lead and coordinate the federal government's R&D programs. If science is being manipulated at the agencies to support separate political and institutional agendas, the President should increase the prominence of the OSTP's Director either formally or informally. This would elevate the role of science in policy discussions and subsequent outcomes and theoretically help to balance out agencies like the Departments of Energy, State, and Commerce and the Environmental Protection Agency and Council on Environmental Quality. The OSTP can also help to bring technical expertise to regulatory matters in support of OMB.\n\nThe OSTP should continue to play a lead role in coordinating federal R&D programs. Recent legislation, especially the CHIPS and Science Act, has expanded federal policy and funding across the enterprise, and there is a need for more significant leadership in this area both to ensure effectiveness and to avoid duplication of effort. As befitting its location in the White House, the OSTP must be concerned with advancing national interests and not merely the parochial concerns of departments, agencies, or parts of the scientific community.\n\nDuring the Trump and Biden Administrations, there has been a bipartisan focus on prioritizing R&D funding around the so-called Industries of the Future (IOTF). Under President Trump, IOTF priorities were artificial intelligence (AI), quantum information science (QIS), advanced communications/5G, advanced manufacturing, and biotechnology. Under President Biden, this list has been expanded to include advanced materials, robotics, battery technology, cybersecurity, green products and clean technology, plant genetics and agricultural technologies, nanotechnology, and semiconductor and microelectronics technologies. These priorities should be evaluated and narrowed to ensure consistency with the next Administration's priorities.\n\nGiven a long list of priorities, coordinating efforts across agencies and measuring success are extremely challenging. The OSTP and OMB are required to work together on an annual basis to prioritize the funding requests and whatever Congress adds on top of them, but there continues to be concern about mission creep and funds expended on nonscientific R&D.\n\nThe President should also issue an executive order to reshape the U.S. Global Change Research Program (USGCRP) and related climate change research programs. The USGCRP produces strategic plans and research (for example, the National Climate Assessment) that reduce the scope of legally proper options in presidential decision-making and in agency rulemakings and adjudications. Also, since much environmental policymaking must run the gauntlet of judicial review, USGCRP actions can frustrate successful litigation defense in ways that the career bureaucracy should not be permitted to control. The process for producing assessments should include diverse viewpoints. The OSTP and OMB should jointly assess the independence of the contractors used to conduct much of this outsourced government research that serves as the basis for policymaking. The next President should critically analyze and, if required, refuse to accept any USGCRP assessment prepared under the Biden Administration.\n\nThe President should also restore related EOP research components to their purely informational and advisory roles. Consistent with the Global Change Research Act of 1990, USGCRP-related EOP components should be confined to a more limited advisory role. These components should include but not necessarily be limited to the OSTP; the NSTC's Committee on Environment; the USGCRP's Interagency Groups (for example, the Carbon Cycle Interagency Working Group); and the Federal Coordinating Council for Science, Engineering, and Technology. As a general matter, the new Administration should separate the scientific risk assessment function from the risk management function, which is the exclusive domain of elected policymakers and the public.\n\nFinally, the next Administration will face a significant challenge in unwinding policies and procedures that are used to advance radical gender, racial, and equity initiatives under the banner of science. Similarly, the Biden Administration's climate fanaticism will need a whole-of-government unwinding. As with other federal departments and agencies, the Biden Administration's leveraging of the federal government's resources to further the woke agenda should be reversed and scrubbed from all policy manuals, guidance documents, and agendas, and scientific excellence and innovation should be restored as the OSTP's top priority.\n\n### COUNCIL ON ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY (CEQ)\n\nThe Council on Environmental Quality is the EOP component with the principal task of administering the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) by issuing regulations and interpretive documents and by overseeing the processes of individual permitting agencies' own NEPA regulations, including categorical exclusions. The CEQ also coordinates environmental policy across the federal government, and its influence has waxed and waned across Administrations.\n\nThe President should instruct the CEQ to rewrite its regulations implementing NEPA along the lines of the historic 2020 effort and restoring its key provisions such as banning the use of cumulative impact analysis. This effort should incorporate new learning and more aggressive reform options that were not included in the 2020 reform package with the overall goal of streamlining the process to build on the Supreme Court ruling that “CEQ's interpretation of NEPA is entitled to substantial deference.” It should frame the new regulations to limit the scope for judicial review of agency NEPA analysis and judicial remedies, as well as to vindicate the strong public interest in effective and timely agency action.\n\nThe Federal Permitting Improvement Steering Council (FPISC), of which the CEQ is a part, has been empowered by Congress through significant new funding and amendments to FAST-41. The President should build on this foundation to further empower the FPISC by making its Executive Director an EOP appointee with delegated presidential directive authority over executive branch permitting agencies. For instance, the implementation of Executive Order 13807's One Federal Decision revealed many ways that the systems established by EO 13807 can be improved. The new President should seek to issue a new executive order to create a unified process for major infrastructure projects that includes giving project proponents more control of any regulatory clocks.\n\nThe President should issue an executive order establishing a Senior Advisor to coordinate the policy development and implementation of relevant energy and environment policy by officials across the EOP (for example, the policy staff of the NSC, NEC, DPC, CEQ, and OSTP) and abolishing the existing Office of Domestic Climate Policy. The Senior Advisor would report directly to the Chief of Staff. The role would be similar to the role that Brian Deese and John Podesta had in the Obama White House. This energy/environment coordinator would help to lead the fight for sound energy and environment policies both domestically and internationally.\n\nThe President should eliminate the Interagency Working Group on the Social Cost of Carbon (SCC), which is cochaired by the OSTP, OMB, and CEA, and by executive order should end the use of SCC analysis.\n\nFinally, the President should work with Congress to establish a sweeping modernization of the entire permitting system across all departments and agencies that is aimed at reducing litigation risk and giving agencies the authority to establish programmatic, general, and provisional permits.\n\n### OFFICE OF NATIONAL DRUG CONTROL POLICY (ONDCP)\n\nCongress created the Office of National Drug Control Policy (ONDCP) through the Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1988 to serve as a coordinative auxiliary for the President on all matters related to drug policy. The next President's top drug policy priority must be to address the current fentanyl crisis and reduce the number of overdoses and fatalities. This crisis resulted in the deaths of more than 100,000 Americans in 2021.\n\nThe next Administration must reaffirm a commitment to preventing drug use before it starts, providing treatment that leads to long-term recovery, and reducing the availability of illicit drugs in the United States. The drug trafficking environment is exponentially more dynamic and dangerous today than it was just five years ago as powerful synthetic opioids (fentanyl and its analogues) are mixed into other drugs of abuse. Drug trafficking organizations are extremely nimble and able to adapt quickly to federal government actions and changes in user behavior. Disrupting the flow of drugs across our borders and into our communities is of paramount importance, both to save lives and to bolster our public health efforts. For these reasons, the Director of ONDCP should make it a point to consult with federal border enforcement officials.\n\nThe National Drug Control Program agencies represented a total of $41 billion in fiscal year 2022. Whereas the position for overseeing budget activities is traditionally held by a career official, it is imperative that a political appointee lead the ONDCP budget office to ensure coordination between the OMB Program Associate Director and the ONDCP budgetary appointee.\n\nONDCP grant-making activities have been controversial over the years, particularly within conservative Administrations concerned that the White House lacks the expertise to oversee such programs directly. The ONDCP administers two grant programs: the Drug-Free Communities Support Program and the High Intensity Drug Trafficking Areas Program. While it makes sense to transfer these programs eventually to the Department of Justice and Department of Health and Human Services, respectively, it is vital that the ONDCP Director ensure in the immediate term that these grant programs are funding the President's drug control priorities and not woke nonprofits with leftist policy agendas. Thus, the President must ensure that the ONDCP is managed by political appointees who are committed to the Administration's agenda and not acquiesce to management by political or career military personnel who oversaw the prior Administration's ONDCP.\n\n### GENDER POLICY COUNCIL (GPC)\n\nThe President should immediately revoke Executive Order 14020 and every policy, including subregulatory guidance documents, produced on behalf of or related to the establishment or promotion of the Gender Policy Council and its subsidiary issues. Abolishing the Gender Policy Council would eliminate central promotion of abortion (“health services”); comprehensive sexuality education (“education”); and the new woke gender ideology, which has as a principal tenet “gender affirming care” and “sex-change” surgeries on minors. In addition to eliminating the council, developing new structures and positions will have the dual effect of demonstrating that promoting life and strengthening the family is a priority while also facilitating more seamless coordination and consistency across the U.S. government.\n\nSpecifically, the President should appoint a position/point of contact with the rank of Special Assistant to the President or higher to coordinate and lead the President's domestic priorities on issues related to life and family in cooperation with the Domestic Policy Council. This position would be responsible for facilitating meetings, discussions, and agreements among personnel; coordinating Administration policy; and ensuring agency support for implementation of policies related to the promotion of life and family in the United States.\n\n### OFFICE OF THE VICE PRESIDENT (OVP)\n\nThe Vice President is elected to the second highest office in the nation and plays a constitutionally vital role as President-in-waiting. The Vice President is also the President of the Senate and is charged with breaking tie votes in that body. In recent years, the Vice President has been granted office space in the West Wing and the Eisenhower Executive Office Building.\n\nThe OVP is another one of the levers that the President should use to execute his agenda. This is particularly true because there is significant and unique leverage that the Vice President's leadership of the OVP can evoke to shape policy discussions and outcomes. Every other appointed White House official serves at the pleasure of the President, whereas the Vice President is elected, and the process for filling vacancies in that Article II constitutional office, which includes confirmation of a replacement Vice President by a majority of both Houses of Congress, is governed by the Twenty-Fifth Amendment.\n\nThe Vice President has his or her own economic advisers, domestic policy and national security staff, and daily intelligence briefings. The Vice President should fill his or her office with strong and sound policy minds to effectively assist the President in fulfilling his agenda.\n\nThe Vice President is also a statutory member of the National Security Council. In theory, in light of the fact that the Vice President is a member of the Smithsonian Institution's Board of Regents, there is nothing to prevent Congress from assigning the Vice President additional statutory duties.\n\nAll of the component councils and offices discussed in this chapter include real policy development and implementation authority, and a robust OVP should be fully integrated into all policy-formation procedures. Only a Vice President who is deeply steeped in the interworking of the interagency and policy councils can offer useful advice and prove helpful in accomplishing the President's agenda. It is also obvious, in view of the fact that many former Vice Presidents have gone on to be elected President in their own right, that the Vice Presidency can act as a training ground for presidential office.\n\nIn the past, the Vice President has been tasked with leading certain initiatives or issues. For example, Mike Pence was tasked with coordinating the federal response to COVID-19, and both Pence and Kamala Harris have chaired the National Space Council. Vice Presidents Richard Cheney and Dan Quayle were also active on the deregulatory front and in imposing regulatory moratoria. However, OVP officials should be fully integrated into each and every process from the start of a new Administration and not have to wait to be invited to join various meetings or working groups on an ad hoc basis. For example, the budget and regulatory review processes are linchpins in the execution of policy, and the OVP should have a seat at the table through every phase of policy development.\n\nPast Vice Presidents have also spent significant time abroad serving as a type of brand ambassador for the White House and, more broadly, for the United States, announcing Administration priorities and coordinating with heads of state and other top officials of foreign governments. The Vice President, as President of the Senate, often serves as a presidential emissary to the Senate and thus can be especially helpful in securing passage of the President's legislative agenda.\n\nTo the extent that he or she desires, a Vice President can have a direct role in shaping Administration policy. A Vice President who regularly attends meetings and disperses staff across the interagency and policy councils is a Vice President whose voice will be heard.\n\nAUTHOR'S NOTE: Special thanks to those who contributed to this chapter: Stephen Billy, Scott Pace, Casey Mulligan, Edie Heipel, Mike Duffey, Vance Ginn, Iain Murray, Laura Cunliffe, Mario Loyola, Anthony Campau, Paige Agostin, Molly Sikes, Paul Ray, Kenneth A.

As the U.S. Constitution makes clear, the President's appointment, direction, and removal authorities are the central elements of his executive power.¹ In implementing that power, the people and the President deserve the most talented and responsible workforce possible.\n\nWho the President assigns to design and implement his political policy agenda will determine whether he can carry out the responsibility given to him by the American people. The President must recognize that whoever holds a government position sets its policy. To fulfill an electoral mandate, he must therefore give personnel management his highest priority, including Cabinet-level precedence.\n\nThe federal government's immense bureaucracy spreads into hundreds of agencies and thousands of units and is centered and overseen at the top by key central personnel agencies and their governing laws and regulations. The major separate personnel agencies in the national government today are:\n\n- The Office of Personnel Management (OPM);\n- The Merit Systems Protection Board (MSPB);\n- The Federal Labor Relations Authority (FLRA); and\n- The Office of Special Counsel (OSC).\n\n## Mandate for Leadership: The Conservative Promise\n\nTitle 5 of the U.S. Code charges the OPM with executing, administering, and enforcing the rules, regulations, and laws governing the civil service.² It grants the OPM direct responsibility for activities like retirement, pay, health, training, federal unionization, suitability, and classification functions not specifically granted to other agencies by statute. The agency's Director is charged with aiding the President, as the President may request, in preparing such civil service rules as the President prescribes and otherwise advising the President on actions that may be taken to promote an efficient civil service and a systematic application of the merit system principles, including recommending policies relating to the selection, promotion, transfer, performance, pay, conditions of service, tenure, and separation of employees.\n\nThe MSPB is the lead adjudicator for hearing and resolving cases and controversies for 2.2 million federal employees.³ It is required to conduct fair and neutral case adjudications, regulatory reviews, and actions and studies to improve the workforce. Its court-like adjudications investigate and hear appeals from agency actions such as furloughs, suspensions, demotions, and terminations and are appealable to the U.S. Court of Appeals.\n\nThe FLRA hears appeals of agency personnel cases involving federal labor grievance procedures to provide judicial review with binding decisions appealable to appeals courts.⁴ It interprets the rights and duties of agencies and employee labor organizations—on management rights, OPM interpretations, recognition of labor organizations, and unfair labor practices—under the general principle of bargaining in good faith and compelling need.\n\nThe OSC serves as the investigator, mediator, publisher, and prosecutor before the MSPB with respect to agency and employees regarding prohibited personnel practices, Hatch Act⁵ politicization, Uniformed Services Employment and Reemployment Rights Act⁶ issues, and whistleblower complaints.⁷\n\nThe Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) has general responsibility for reviewing charges of employee discrimination against all civil rights breaches. However, it also administers a government employee section that investigates and adjudicates federal employee complaints concerning equal employment violations as with the private sector.⁸ This makes the agency an additional de facto factor in government personnel management.\n\nWhile not a personnel agency per se, the General Services Administration (GSA) is charged with general supervision of contracting.⁹ Today, there are many more contractors in government than there are civil service employees. The GSA must therefore be a part of any personnel management discussion.\n\n## ANALYSIS AND RECOMMENDATIONS\n\n### OPM: Managing the Federal Bureaucracy\n\nAt the very pinnacle of the modern progressive program to make government competent stands the ideal of professionalized, career civil service. Since the turn of the 20th century, progressives have sought a system that could effectively select, train, reward, and guard from partisan influence the neutral scientific experts they believe are required to staff the national government and run the administrative state. Their U.S. system was initiated by the Pendleton Act of 1883¹⁰ and institutionalized by the 1930s New Deal to set principles and practices that were meant to ensure that expert merit rather than partisan favors or personal favoritism ruled within the federal bureaucracy. Yet, as public frustration with the civil service has grown, generating calls to “drain the swamp,” it has become clear that their project has had serious unintended consequences.\n\nThe civil service was devised to replace the amateurism and presumed corruption of the old spoils system, wherein government jobs rewarded loyal partisans who might or might not have professional backgrounds. Although the system appeared to be sufficient for the nation's first century, progressive intellectuals and activists demanded a more professionalized, scientific, and politically neutral Administration. Progressives designed a merit system to promote expertise and shield bureaucrats from partisan political pressure, but it soon began to insulate civil servants from accountability. The modern merit system increasingly made it almost impossible to fire all but the most incompetent civil servants. Complying with arcane rules regarding recruiting, rating, hiring, and firing simply replaced the goal of cultivating competence and expertise.\n\nIn the 1970s, Georgia Democratic Governor Jimmy Carter, then a political unknown, ran for President supporting New Deal programs and their Great Society expansion but opposing the way they were being administered. The policies were not actually reducing poverty, increasing prosperity, or improving the environment, he argued, and to make them work required fundamental bureaucratic reform. He correctly charged that almost all government employees were rated as “successful,” all received the same pay regardless of performance, and even the worst were impossible to fire—and he won the presidency.\n\nPresident Carter fulfilled his campaign promise by hiring Syracuse University Dean Alan Campbell, who served first as Chairman of the U.S. Civil Service Commission and then as Director of the OPM and helped him devise and pass the Civil Service Reform Act of 1978 (CSRA)¹¹ to reset the basic structure of today's bureaucracy. A new performance appraisal system was devised with a five rather than three distribution of rating categories and individual goals more related to agency missions and more related to employee promotion for all. Pay and benefits were based directly on improved performance appraisals (including sizable bonuses) for mid-level managers and senior executives. But time ran out on President Carter before the act could be fully executed, so it was left to President Ronald Reagan and his new OPM and agency leadership to implement.\n\nOverall, the new law seemed to work for a few years under Reagan, but the Carter–Reagan reforms were dissipated within a decade. Today, employee evaluation is back to pre-reform levels with almost all rated successful or above, frustrating any relation between pay and performance. An “outstanding” rating should be required for Senior Executive Service (SES) chiefs to win big bonuses, but a few years ago, when it was disclosed that the Veterans Administration executives who encouraged false reporting of waiting lists for hospital admission were rated outstanding, the Senior Executive Association justified it, telling Congress that only outstanding performers would be promoted to the SES in the first place and that precise ratings were unnecessary.¹² The Government Accountability Office (GAO), however, has reported that pay raises, within-grade pay increases, and locality pay for regular employees and executives have become automatic rather than based on performance—as a result of most employees being rated at similar appraisal levels.¹³\n\n### The Centrality of Performance Appraisal\n\nIn the meantime, the OPM must manage the workforce it has. Before they can reward or discipline federal employees, managers must first identify who their top performers are and who is performing less than adequately. In fact, as Ludwig von Mises proved in his classic *Bureaucracy*, unlike the profit-and-loss evaluation tool used in the private sector, government performance measurement depends totally on a functioning appraisal system. If they cannot be identified in the first place within a functioning appraisal system, it is impossible to reward good performance or correct poor performance. The problem is that the collegial atmosphere of a bureaucracy in a multifaceted appraisal system that is open to appeals makes this a very challenging ideal to implement successfully.\n\nThe GAO reported more recently that overly high and widely spread performance ratings were again plaguing the government, with more than 99 percent of employees rated fully successful or above by their managers, a mere 0.3 percent rated as minimally successful, and 0.1 percent actually rated unacceptable. Why? It is human nature that no one appreciates being told that he or she is less than outstanding in every way. Informing subordinates in a closely knit bureaucracy that they are not performing well is difficult. Rating compatriots is even considered rude and unprofessional. Moreover, managers can be and often are accused of racial or sexual discrimination for a poor rating, and this discourages honesty.\n\nIn 2018, President Trump issued Executive Order 13839 requiring agencies to reduce the time for employees to improve performance before corrective action could be taken; to initiate disciplinary actions against poorly performing employees more expeditiously; to reiterate that agencies are obligated to make employees improve; to reduce the time for employees to respond to allegations of poor performance; to mandate that agencies remind supervisors of expiring employee probationary periods; to prohibit agencies from entering into settlement agreements that modify an employee's personnel record; and to reevaluate procedures for agencies to discipline supervisors who retaliate against whistleblowers. Unfortunately, the order was overturned by the Biden Administration, so it will need to be reintroduced in 2025.\n\nThe fact remains that meaningfully evaluating employees' performance is a critical part of a manager's job. In the Reagan appraisal process, managers were evaluated on how they themselves rated their subordinates. This is critical to responsibility and improved management. It is essential that political executives build policy goals directly into employee appraisals both for mission success and for employees to know what is expected. Indistinguishable from their coworkers on paper, hard-working federal employees often go unrewarded for their efforts and are often the system's greatest critics. Federal workers who are performing inadequately get neither the benefit of an honest appraisal nor clear guidance on how to improve. Political executives should take an active role in supervising performance appraisals of career staff, not unduly delegate this responsibility to senior career managers, and be willing to reward and support good performers.\n\n### Merit Pay\n\nPerformance appraisal means little to daily operations if it is not tied directly to real consequences for success as well as failure. According to a survey of major U.S. private companies—which, unlike the federal government, also have a profit-and-loss evaluation—90 percent use a system of merit pay for performance based on some type of appraisal system. Despite early efforts to institute merit pay throughout the federal government, however, compensation is still based primarily on seniority rather than merit.\n\nMerit pay for executives and managers was part of the Carter reforms and was implemented early in the Reagan presidency. Beginning in the summer of 1982, the Reagan OPM entered 18 months of negotiations with House and Senate staff on extending merit pay to the entire workforce. Long and detailed talks between the OPM and both Democrats and Republicans in Congress ensued, and a final agreement was reached in 1983 that supposedly ensured the passage of legislation creating a new Performance Management and Recognition System (PMRS) for all, (not just management) GS-13 through GS-15 employees.\n\nMeanwhile, the OPM issued regulations to expand the role of performance related to pay throughout the entire workforce, but congressional allies of the employee unions, led by Representative Steny Hoyer (D) of government employee–rich Maryland, stoutly resisted this extension of pay-for-performance and, with strong union support, used the congressional appropriations process to block OPM administrative pay reforms. Bonuses for SES career employees survived, but performance appraisals became so high and widely distributed that there was little relationship between performance and remuneration.\n\nEver since the original merit pay system for federal managers (GM-13 through GM-15 grade levels, just below the SES) was allowed to expire in September 1993, little to nothing has been done either to reinstate the federal merit pay program for managers or to distribute performance rating evaluations for the SES, much less to extend the program to the remainder of the workforce. A reform-friendly President and Congress might just provide the opportunity to create a more comprehensive performance plan; in the meantime, however, political executives should use existing pay and especially fiscal awards strategically to reward good performance to the degree allowed by law.\n\n### Making the Appeals Process Work\n\nThe nonmilitary government dismissal rate is well below 1 percent, and no private-sector industry employee enjoys the job security that a federal employee enjoys. Both safety and justice demand that managers learn to act strategically to hire good and fire poor performers legally. The initial paperwork required to separate poor or abusive performers (when they are infrequently identified) is not overwhelming, and managers might be motivated to act if it were not for the appeals and enforcement processes. Formal appeal in the private sector is mostly a rather simple two-step process, but government unions and associations have been able to convince politicians to support a multiple and extensive appeals and enforcement process.\n\nAs noted, there are multiple administrative appeals bodies. The FLRA, OSC, and EEOC have relatively narrow jurisdictions. Claims that an employee's removal or disciplinary actions violate the terms of a collective bargaining agreement between an agency and a union are handled by the FLRA, employees who claim their removal was the result of discrimination can appeal to the EEOC, and employees who believe their firing was retribution for being a whistleblower can go to the OSC. While the MSPB specializes in abuses of direct merit system issues, it can and does hear and review almost any of the matters heard by the other agencies.\n\nCases involving race, gender, religion, age, pregnancy, disability, or national origin can be appealed to the EEOC or the MSPB—and in some cases to both—and to the OSC. This gives employees multiple opportunities to prove their cases, and while the EEOC, MSPB, FLRA, and OSC may all apply essentially the same burden of proof, the odds of success may be substantially different in each forum. In fact, forum shopping among them for a friendlier venue is a common practice, but frequent filers face no consequences for frivolous complaints. As a result, meritorious cases are frequently delayed, denying relief and justice to truly aggrieved individuals.\n\nThe MSPB can and does handle all such matters, but it faces a backlog of an estimated 3,000 cases of people who were potentially wrongfully terminated or disciplined as far back as 2013. From 2017–2022 the MSPB lacked the quorum required to decide appeals. On the other hand, as of January 2023, the EEOC had a backlog of 42,000 cases.\n\nWhile federal employees win appeals relatively infrequently—MSPB administrative judges have upheld agency decisions as much as 80 percent of the time—the real problem is the time and paperwork involved in the elaborate process that managers must undergo during appeals. This keeps even the best managers from bringing cases in all but the most egregious cases of poor performance or misconduct. As a result, the MSPB, EEOC, FLRA, and OSC likely see very few cases compared to the number of occurrences, and nonperformers continue to be paid and often are placed in nonwork positions.\n\nHaving a choice of appeals is especially unique to the government. If lower-priority issues were addressed in-house, serious adverse actions would be less subject to delay. With the proper limitation of labor union actions, the FLRA should have limited reason for appeals. The EEOC's federal employee section should be transferred to the MSPB, and many of the OCS's investigatory functions should be returned to the OPM. The MSPB could then become the main reviewer of adverse actions, greatly simplifying the burdensome appeal process.\n\n### Making Civil Service Benefits Economically and Administratively Rational\n\nIn recent years, the combined wages and benefits of the executive branch civilian workforce totaled $300 billion according to official data. But even that amount does not properly account for billions in unfunded liability for retirement and other government reporting distortions. Official data also report employment as approximately 2 million, but this ignores approximately 20 million contractors who, while not eligible for government pay and benefits, do receive them indirectly through contracting (even if they are less generous). Official data also claim that national government employees are paid less than private-sector employees are paid for similar work, but several more neutral sources demonstrate that public-sector workers make more on average than their private-sector counterparts. All of this extravagance deserves close scrutiny.\n\n#### Market-Based Pay and Benefits\n\nAccording to current law, federal workers are to be paid wages comparable to equivalent private-sector workers rather than compared to all private-sector employees. While the official studies claim that federal employees are underpaid relative to the private sector by 20 percent or more, a 2016 Heritage Foundation study found that federal employees received wages that were 22 percent higher than wages for similar private-sector workers; if the value of employee benefits was included, the total compensation premium for federal employees over their private-sector equivalents increased to between 30 percent and 40 percent.18 The American Enterprise Institute found a 14 percent pay premium and a 61 percent total compensation premium.19\n\nBase salary is only one component of a federal employee's total compensation. In addition to high starting wages, federal employees normally receive an annual cost-of-living adjustment (available to all employees) and generous scheduled raises known as step increases. Moreover, a large proportion of federal employees are stationed in the Washington, D.C., area and other large cities and are entitled to steep locality pay enhancement to account for the high cost of living in these areas.\n\nA federal employee with five years' experience receives 20 vacation days, 13 paid sick days, and all 10 federal holidays compared to an employee at a large private company who receives 13 days of vacation and eight paid sick days. Federal health benefits are more comparable to those provided by Fortune 500 employers with the government paying 72 percent of the weighted average premiums, but this is much higher than for most private plans. Almost half of private firms do not offer any employer contributions at all.\n\nThe obvious solution to these discrepancies is to move closer to a market model for federal pay and benefits. One need is for a neutral agency to oversee pay hiring decisions, especially for high-demand occupations. The OPM is independent of agency operations, so it can assess requirements more neutrally. For many years, with its Special Pay Rates program, the OPM evaluated claims that federal rates in an area were too low to attract competent employees and allowed agencies to offer higher pay when needed rather than increased rates for all. Ideally, the OPM should establish an initial pay schedule for every occupation and region, monitor turnover rates and applicant-to-position ratios, and adjust pay and recruitment on that basis. Most of this requires legislation, but the OPM should be an advocate for a true equality of benefits between the public and private sectors.\n\n#### Reforming Federal Retirement Benefits\n\nCareer civil servants enjoy retirement benefits that are nearly unheard of in the private sector. Federal employees retire earlier (normally at age 55 after 30 years), enjoy richer pension annuities, and receive automatic cost-of-living adjustments based on the areas in which they retire. Defined-benefit federal pensions are fully indexed for inflation—a practice that is extremely rare in the private sector. A federal employee with a preretirement income of $25,000 under the older of the two federal retirement plans will receive at least $200,000 more over a 20-year period than will private-sector workers with the same preretirement salary under historic inflation levels.\n\nDuring the early Reagan years, the OPM reformed many specific provisions of the federal pension program to save billions administratively. Under OPM pressure, Reagan and Congress ultimately ended the old Civil Service Retirement System (CSRS) entirely for new employees, which (counting disbursements for the unfunded liability) accounted for 51.3 percent of the federal government's total payroll. The retirement system that replaced it—the Federal Employees Retirement System (FERS)—reduced the cost of federal employee retirement disbursements to 28.5 percent of payroll (including contributions to Social Security and the employer match to the Thrift Savings Plan). More of the pension cost was shifted to the employee, but the new system was much more equitable for the 40 percent who received few or no benefits under the old system.\n\nBy 1999, more than half of the federal workforce was covered by the new system, and the government's per capita share of the cost (as the employer) was less than half the cost of the old system: 20.2 percent of FERS payroll vs. 44.3 percent of CSRS payroll, representing one of the largest examples of government savings anywhere. Although the government pension system has become more like private pension systems, it still remains much more generous, and other means might be considered in the future to move it even closer to private plans.\n\n### GSA: Landlord and Contractor Management\n\nThe General Services Administration is best known as the federal government's landlord—designing, constructing, managing, and preserving government buildings and leasing and managing outside commercial real estate contracting with 376.9 million square feet of space. Obviously, as its prime function, real estate expertise is key to the GSA's success. However, the GSA is also the government's purchasing agent, connecting federal purchasers with commercial products and services in the private sector and their personnel management functions. With contractors performing so many functions today, the GSA therefore becomes a de facto part of governmentwide personnel management. The GSA also manages the Presidential Transition Act (PTA) process, which also directly involves the OPM. A recent proposal would have incorporated the OPM and GSA (and OMB). Fortunately, this did not take place in that form, but it would make sense for GSA and OPM leadership and staff to hold regular meetings to work through matters of common interest such as moderating PTA personnel restrictions and the relationships between contract and civil service employees.\n\n### Reductions-in-Force\n\nReducing the number of federal employees seems an obvious way to reduce the overall expense of the civil service, and many prior Administrations have attempted to do just this. Presidents Bill Clinton and Barack Obama began their terms, as did Ronald Reagan and Donald Trump, by mandating a freeze on the hiring of new federal employees, but these efforts did not lead to permanent and substantive reductions in the number of nondefense federal employees.\n\nFirst, it is a challenge even to know which workers to cut. As mentioned, there are 2 million federal employees, but since budgets have exploded, so has the total number of personnel with nearly 10 times more federal contractors than federal employees. Contractors are less expensive because they are not entitled to high government pensions or benefits and are easier to fire and discipline. In addition, millions of state government employees work under federal grants, in effect administering federal programs; these cannot be cut directly. Cutting federal employment can be helpful and can provide a simple story to average citizens, but cutting functions, levels, funds, and grants is much more important than setting simple employment size.\n\nSimply reducing numbers can actually increase costs. OMB instructions following President Trump's employment freeze told agencies to consider buyout programs, encouraging early retirements in order to shift costs from current budgets in agencies to the retirement system and minimize the number of personnel fired. The Environmental Protection Agency immediately implemented such a program, and OMB urged the passage of legislation to increase payout maximums from $25,000 to $40,000 to further increase spending under the “cuts.” President Clinton's OMB had introduced a similar buyout that cost the Treasury $2.8 billion, mostly for those who were going to retire anyway. Moreover, when a new employee is hired to fill a job recently vacated in a buyout, the government for a time is paying two people to fill one job.\n\n### Impenetrable Bureaucracy\n\nThe GAO has identified almost a hundred actions that the executive branch or Congress could take to improve efficiency and effectiveness across 37 areas that span a broad range of government missions and functions. It identified 33 actions to address mission fragmentation, overlap, and duplication in the 12 areas of defense, economic development, health, homeland security, and information technology. It also identified 59 other opportunities for executive agencies or Congress to reduce the cost of government operations or enhance revenue collection across 25 areas of government.\n\nA logical place to begin would be to identify and eliminate functions and programs that are duplicated across Cabinet departments or spread across multiple agencies. Congress hoped to help this effort by passing the Government Performance and Results Act of 1993, which required all federal agencies to define their missions, establish goals and objectives, and measure and report their performance to Congress. Three decades of endless time-consuming reports later, the government continues to grow but with more paper and little change either in performance or in the number of levels between government and the people.\n\nThe Brookings Institution's Paul Light emphasizes the importance of the increasing number of levels between the top heads of departments and the people at the bottom who receive the products of government decision-making. He estimates that there are perhaps 50 or more levels of impenetrable bureaucracy and no way other than imperfect performance appraisals to communicate between them.\n\nThe Trump Administration proposed some possible consolidations, but these were not received favorably in Congress, whose approval is necessary for most such proposals. The best solution is to cut functions and budgets and devolve responsibilities. That is a challenge primarily for Presidents, Congress, and the entire government, but the OPM still needs to lead the way governmentwide in managing personnel properly even in any future smaller government.\n\n### Creating a Responsible Career Management Service\n\nThe people elect a President who is charged by Article 2, Section 3 of the Constitution with seeing that the laws are “faithfully executed” with his political appointees democratically linked to that legitimizing responsibility. An autonomous bureaucracy has neither independent constitutional status nor separate moral legitimacy. Therefore, career civil servants by themselves should not lead major policy changes and reforms.\n\nThe creation of the Senior Executive Service was the top career change introduced by the 1978 Carter–Campbell Civil Service Reform Act. Its aim was to professionalize the career service and make it more responsible to the democratically elected commander in chief and his political appointees while respecting the rights due to career employees, very much including those in the top positions. The new SES would allow management to be more flexible in filling and reassigning executive positions and locations beyond narrow specialties for more efficient mission accomplishment and would provide pay and large bonuses to motivate career performance.\n\nThe desire to infiltrate political appointees improperly into the high career civil service has been widespread in every Administration, whether Democrat or Republican. Democratic Administrations, however, are typically more successful because they require the cooperation of careerists, who generally lean heavily to the Left. Such burrowing-in requires career job descriptions for new positions that closely mirror the functions of a political appointee; a special hiring authority that allows the bypassing of veterans' preference as well as other preference categories; and the ability to frustrate career candidates from taking the desired position.\n\nPresident Reagan's OPM began by limiting such SES burrowing-in, arguing that the proper course was to create and fill political positions. This simultaneously promotes the CSRA principle of political leadership of the bureaucracy and respects the professional autonomy of the career service. But this requires that career SES employees should respect political rights too. Actions such as career staff reserving excessive numbers of key policy positions as “career reserved” to deny them to noncareer SES employees frustrate CSRA intent. Another evasion is the general domination by career staff on SES personnel evaluation boards, the opposite of noncareer executives dominating these critical meeting discussions as expected in the SES. Career training also often underplays the political role in leadership and inculcates career-first policy and value viewpoints.\n\nFrustrated with these activities by top career executives, the Trump Administration issued Executive Order 13957 to make career professionals in positions that are not normally subject to change as a result of a presidential transition but who discharge significant duties and exercise significant discretion in formulating and implementing executive branch policy and programs an exception to the competitive hiring rules and examinations for career positions under a new Schedule F. It ordered the Director of OPM and agency heads to set procedures to prepare lists of such confidential, policy-determining, policymaking, or policy-advocating positions and prepare procedures to create exceptions from civil service rules when careerists hold such positions, from which they can relocate back to the regular civil service after such service. The order was subsequently reversed by President Biden at the demand of the civil service associations and unions. It should be reinstated, but SES responsibility should come first.\n\n### Managing Personnel in a Union Environment\n\nHistorically, unions were thought to be incompatible with government management. There is a natural limit to the bargaining power of private-sector unions, but the financial bottom line of public-sector unions is not similarly constrained. If private-sector unions push too hard a bargain, they can so harm a company or so reduce efficiency that their employer is forced to go out of business and eliminate union jobs altogether. There is no such limit in government, which cannot go out of business, so demands can be excessive without negatively affecting employee and union bottom lines.\n\nEven Democratic President Franklin Roosevelt considered union representation in the federal government to be incompatible with democracy. Striking and even threats of bargaining and delay were considered acts against the people and thus improper. It was not until President John Kennedy that union representation in the federal government was recognized—and then merely by executive order. Labor bargaining was not set in statute until the Carter Administration was forced by Congress to do so in order to pass the CSRA, although all bargaining was placed under OPM review.\n\nThe CSRA was able to maintain strong management rights for the OPM and agencies and forbade collective bargaining on pay and benefits as well as management prerogatives. Over time, OPM, FLRA, and agencies' personnel offices and courts, especially in Democratic Administrations, narrowed management rights so that labor bargaining expanded as management rights contracted. But the management rights are still in statute, have been enforced by some Administrations, and should be enforced again by any future OPM and agency managements, which should not be intimidated by union power.\n\nRather than being daunted, President Trump issued three executive orders:\n\n- **Executive Order 13836**: Encouraging agencies to renegotiate all union collective bargaining agreements to ensure consistency with the law and respect for management rights.  \n- **Executive Order 13837**: Encouraging agencies to prevent union representatives from using official time preparing or pursuing grievances or from engaging in other union activity on government time.  \n- **Executive Order 13839**: Encouraging agencies both to limit labor grievances on removals from service or on challenging performance appraisals and to prioritize performance over seniority when deciding who should be retained following reductions-in-force.\n\nAll were revoked by the Biden Administration and should be reinstated by the next Administration, to include the immediate appointment of the FLRA General Counsel and reactivation of the Impasses Panel.\n\nCongress should also consider whether public-sector unions are appropriate in the first place. The bipartisan consensus up until the middle of the 20th century held that these unions were not compatible with constitutional government. After more than half a century of experience with public-sector union frustrations of good government management, it is hard to avoid reaching the same conclusion.\n\n### Fully Staffing the Ranks of Political Appointees\n\nThe President must rely legally on his top department and agency officials to run the government and on top White House staff employees to coordinate operations through regular Cabinet and other meetings and communications. Without this political leadership, the career civil service becomes empowered to lead the executive branch without democratic legitimacy. While many obstacles stand in his way, a President is constitutionally and statutorily required to fill the top political positions in the executive branch both to assist him and to provide overall legitimacy.\n\nMost Presidents have had some difficulty obtaining congressional approval of their appointees, but this has worsened recently. After the 2016 election, President Trump faced special hostility from the opposition party and the media in getting his appointees confirmed or even considered by the Senate. His early Office of Presidential Personnel (PPO) did not generally remove political appointees from the previous Administration but instead relied mostly on prior political appointees and career civil servants to run the government. Such a reliance on holdovers and bureaucrats led to a lack of agency control and the absolute refusal of the Acting Attorney General from the Obama Administration to obey a direct order from the President.\n\nUnder the early PPO, the Trump Administration appointed fewer political appointees in its first few months in office than had been appointed in any recent presidency, partly because of historically high partisan congressional obstructions but also because several officials announced that they preferred fewer political appointees in the agencies as a way to cut federal spending. Whatever the reasoning, this had the effect of permanently hampering the rollout of the new President's agenda. Thus, in those critical early years, much of the government relied on senior careerists and holdover Obama appointees to carry out the sensitive responsibilities that would otherwise belong to the new President's appointees.\n\nFortunately, the later PPO, OPM, and Senate leadership began to cooperate to build a strong team to implement the President's personnel appointment agenda. Any new Administration would be wise to learn that it will need a full cadre of sound political appointees from the beginning if it expects to direct this enormous federal bureaucracy. A close relationship between the PPO at the White House and the OPM, coordinating with agency assistant secretaries of administration and PPO's chosen White House Liaisons and their staff at each agency, is essential to the management of this large, multilevel, resistant, and bureaucratic challenge. If “personnel is policy” is to be our general guide, it would make sense to give the President direct supervision of the bureaucracy with the OPM Director available in his Cabinet.\n\n### A Reformed Bureaucracy\n\nToday, the federal government's bureaucracy cannot even meet its own civil service ideals. The merit criteria of ability, knowledge, and skills are no longer the basis for recruitment, selection, or advancement, while pay and benefits for comparable work are substantially above those in the private sector. Retention is not based primarily on performance, and for the most part, inadequate performance is not appraised, corrected, or punished.\n\nThe authors have made many suggestions here that, if implemented, could bring that bureaucracy more under control and enable it to work more efficiently and responsibly, which is especially required for the half of civilian government that administers its undeniable responsibilities for defense and foreign affairs. While a better administered central bureaucracy is crucial for both those and domestic responsibilities, the problem of properly running the government goes beyond simple bureaucratic administration. The specific deficiencies of the federal bureaucracy—size, levels of organization, inefficiency, expense, and lack of responsiveness to political leadership—are rooted in the progressive ideology that unelected experts can and should be trusted to promote the general welfare in just about every area of social life.\n\nThe Constitution, however, reserved a few enumerated powers to the federal government while leaving the great majority of domestic activities to state, local, and private governance. As James Madison explained: “The powers reserved to the several States will extend to all the objects, which, in the ordinary course of affairs, concern the lives, liberties and properties of the people; and the internal order, improvement and prosperity of the state.” Modern progressive politics has simply given the national government more to do than the complex separation-of-powers Constitution allows.\n\nThat progressive system has broken down in our time, and the only real solution is for the national government to do less: to decentralize and privatize as much as possible and then ensure that the remaining bureaucracy is managed effectively along the lines of the enduring principles set out in detail here.\n\n### Authors' Note\n\nThe authors are grateful for the collaborative work of the individuals listed as contributors to this chapter for the 2025 Presidential Transition Project.

It has almost 3 million people serving in uniform or a civilian capacity throughout the world and consumes approximately $850 billion annually—more than 50 percent of our government's discretionary spending.\n\nThe DOD is also a deeply troubled institution. Historically, the military has been one of America's most trusted institutions, but years of sustained misuse, a two-tiered culture of accountability that shields senior officers and officials while exposing junior officers and soldiers in the field, wasteful spending, wildly shifting security policies, exceedingly poor discipline in program execution, and (most recently) the Biden Administration's profoundly unserious equity agenda and vaccine mandates have taken a serious toll.\n\nOur disastrous withdrawal from Afghanistan, our impossibly muddled China strategy, the growing involvement of senior military officers in the political arena, and deep confusion about the purpose of our military are clear signals of a disturbing decay and markers of a dangerous decline in our nation's capabilities and will. Additionally, more than 100,000 Americans die annually in large measure because of illicit narcotics flows—more than four times as many people in one year as we lost in our 20-year war against al-Qaeda.\n\nWe also are witnessing a transformation in the character of war. The democratization of technology and the collapse of time and space require dramatic, thoughtful changes in how we defend, deter, and fight. As with any huge bureaucracy—and the DOD is one of the world's largest—breaking the status quo requires leadership and endurance. Technology is critical to maintaining our warfighting primacy, but we must be leery of the siren song that technology alone can protect us. More important is how new technologies are developed, tested, procured, and used, and that relies on the true competitive advantages of our people: ingenuity, common sense, and thoughtfulness grounded in a free society. Because war will continue to be the most stressful and consequential human endeavor, the most powerful weapon systems will remain the six inches between the ears of our citizens and the strength of their hearts and content of their souls.\n\nMilitary service is the most difficult task we ask of our citizens, and our nation is enormously blessed that so many young, patriotic Americans eagerly volunteer to carry such a heavy burden. We owe them everything, and we must do better. To do better, however, means recognizing and implementing four overriding priorities:\n\n- **Priority No. 1**: Reestablish a culture of command accountability, nonpoliticization, and warfighting focus.\n- **Priority No. 2**: Transform our armed forces for maximum effectiveness in an era of great-power competition.\n- **Priority No. 3**: Provide necessary support to Department of Homeland Security (DHS) border protection operations. Border protection is a national security issue that requires sustained attention and effort by all elements of the executive branch.\n- **Priority No. 4**: Demand financial transparency and accountability.\n\nThis chapter offers recommendations for improving our armed forces and the civilian organizations that support and oversee them.\n\n## DOD Policy\n\nBy far the most significant danger to Americans' security, freedoms, and prosperity is China. China is by any measure the most powerful state in the world other than the United States itself. It apparently aspires to dominate Asia and then, from that position, become globally preeminent. If Beijing could achieve this goal, it could dramatically undermine America's core interests, including by restricting U.S. access to the world's most important market. Preventing this from happening must be the top priority for American foreign and defense policy.\n\nBeijing presents a challenge to American interests across the domains of national power, but the military threat that it poses is especially acute and significant. China is undertaking a historic military buildup that includes increasing capability for power projection not only in its own region, but also far beyond as well as a dramatic expansion of its nuclear forces that could result in a nuclear force that matches or exceeds America's own nuclear arsenal.\n\nThe most severe immediate threat that Beijing's military poses, however, is to Taiwan and other U.S. allies along the first island chain in the Western Pacific. If China could subordinate Taiwan or allies like the Philippines, South Korea, and Japan, it could break apart any balancing coalition that is designed to prevent Beijing's hegemony over Asia. Accordingly, the United States must ensure that China does not succeed. This requires a denial defense: the ability to make the subordination of Taiwan or other U.S. allies in Asia prohibitively difficult. Critically, the United States must be able to do this at a level of cost and risk that Americans are willing to bear given the relative importance of Taiwan to China and to the U.S.\n\nThe United States and its allies also face real threats from Russia, as evidenced by Vladimir Putin's brutal war in Ukraine, as well as from Iran, North Korea, and transnational terrorism at a time when decades of ill-advised military operations in the Greater Middle East, the atrophy of our defense industrial base, the impact of sequestration, and effective disarmament by many U.S. allies have exacted a high toll on America's military.\n\nThis is a grim landscape. The United States needs to deal with these threats forthrightly and with strength, but it also needs to be realistic. It cannot wish away these problems. Rather, it must confront them with a clear-eyed recognition of the need for choice, discipline, and adequate resources for defense.\n\nIn this light, U.S. defense strategy must identify China unequivocally as the top priority for U.S. defense planning while modernizing and expanding the U.S. nuclear arsenal and sustaining an efficient and effective counterterrorism enterprise. U.S. allies must also step up, with some joining the United States in taking on China in Asia while others take more of a lead in dealing with threats from Russia in Europe, Iran, the Middle East, and North Korea. The reality is that achieving these goals will require more spending on defense, both by the United States and by its allies, as well as active support for reindustrialization and more support for allies' productive capacity so that we can scale our free-world efforts together.\n\n## Needed Reforms\n\n- **Prioritize a denial defense against China**. U.S. defense planning should focus on China and, in particular, the effective denial defense of Taiwan. This focus and priority for U.S. defense activities will deny China the first island chain.\n  1. Require that all U.S. defense efforts, from force planning to employment and posture, focus on ensuring the ability of American forces to prevail in the pacing scenario and deny China a fait accompli against Taiwan.\n  2. Prioritize the U.S. conventional force planning construct to defeat a Chinese invasion of Taiwan before allocating resources to other missions, such as simultaneously fighting another conflict.\n\n- **Increase allied conventional defense burden-sharing**. U.S. allies must take far greater responsibility for their conventional defense. U.S. allies must play their part not only in dealing with China, but also in dealing with threats from Russia, Iran, and North Korea.\n  1. Make burden-sharing a central part of U.S. defense strategy with the United States not just helping allies to step up, but strongly encouraging them to do so.\n  2. Support greater spending and collaboration by Taiwan and allies in the Asia–Pacific like Japan and Australia to create a collective defense model.\n  3. Transform NATO so that U.S. allies are capable of fielding the great majority of the conventional forces required to deter Russia while relying on the United States primarily for our nuclear deterrent, and select other capabilities while reducing the U.S. force posture in Europe.\n  4. Sustain support for Israel even as America empowers Gulf partners to take responsibility for their own coastal, air, and missile defenses both individually and working collectively.\n  5. Enable South Korea to take the lead in its conventional defense against North Korea.\n\n- **Implement nuclear modernization and expansion**. The United States manifestly needs to modernize, adapt, and expand its nuclear arsenal. Russia maintains and is actively brandishing a very large nuclear arsenal, but China is also undertaking a historic nuclear breakout.\n  1. Expand and modernize the U.S. nuclear force so that it has the size, sophistication, and tailoring to deter Russia and China simultaneously.\n  2. Develop a nuclear arsenal with the size, sophistication, and tailoring—including new capabilities at the theater level—to ensure that there is no circumstance in which America is exposed to serious nuclear coercion.\n\n- **Increase allied counterterrorist burden-sharing**. Transnational terrorism remains a threat to Americans even as we pivot toward Asia.\n  1. Sustain the military forces needed to deter, prevent, and combat terrorism, but at a sustainable cost in concert with other elements of national power and partner efforts.\n  2. Prioritize enhancing the capability of allies and partners to take the lead in combating terrorism in their regions.\n\n### DOD ACQUISITION AND SUSTAINMENT (A&S)\n\nThe DOD's ability to acquire and field new and existing technologies is essential to the ability of America's military personnel to fight and win our nation's wars. To succeed in this endeavor, we must optimize the systems and personnel that the department uses, but the inflexible bureaucratic structure and risk-averse culture that have developed over the decades make it difficult to provide the tools that warfighters need at the speed of relevance.\n\nThe number one problem is the DOD budgeting process (instituted in 1961) that requires acquisition spending to be locked years in advance. Because technologies change so rapidly and requirements can change overnight, this creates situations in which military personnel not only go to war with outdated technology, but also may be fighting with equipment that is less capable than that of their competitors. America owes its military many things, and the most important is the resources they need to survive on the battlefield and carry out the tasks we ask of them.\n\n#### Needed Reforms\n\n- **Reform the planning, programming, budgeting, and execution (PPBE) process**.\n  1. Enhance funding and authority for DOD mission-focused innovation organizations and away from program-specific stovepipes that, planned for and designed two or three years earlier, may no longer be relevant. This allows the acquisition community to focus on portfolio management and move money around more easily instead of being locked into inflexible, multiyear procurement cycles.\n  2. The President should examine the recommendations of the congressionally mandated Commission on Planning, Programming, Budgeting, and Execution Reform and develop a strategy for implementing those that the Administration considers to be in the best interests of the American people.\n  3. Develop legislation or other means of providing funding outside the traditional PPBE process for the prototyping and experimentation of emerging technologies that are deemed essential to modernization and future conflict. Consider creating a “fast track” for projects that satisfy the most pressing national security needs.\n  4. Require the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition and Sustainment, the Under Secretary for Research and Engineering, and all service secretaries to conduct “Night Court” and use existing authorities to terminate outdated or underperforming programs so that money can be used for what works and will work. Require the Under Secretaries and service secretaries to brief the Secretary annually on the results.\n  5. Require the Office of the Secretary of Defense to research and report on the acquisition processes used by America's adversaries to improve our understanding of how they are often able to innovate and field new technologies on a faster timeline.\n\n- **Strengthen America's defense industrial base**.\n  1. Replenish and maintain U.S. stockpiles of ammunition and other equipment that have been depleted as a result of U.S. support to Ukraine. This will strengthen the defense industry supply chain and ensure that adequate inventory exists if it is needed for a future conflict.\n  2. Collaborate with industry to develop a prioritized list of reforms that the DOD and Congress can enact and implement to incentivize industry to help America's military innovate and field needed capabilities.\n  3. Strengthen the ability of acquisition authorities to engage in multiyear procurements and block buys. This will improve private-sector rates of return, thereby incentivizing defense contractors to partner with the government. It will also reduce government overhead by reducing the number of procurement competitions.\n  4. Prioritize the U.S. and allies under the “domestic end product” and “domestic components” requirements of the Build America, Buy America Act. Manufacturing components and end products domestically and with allies spurs factory development, increases American jobs, and builds resilience in America's defense industrial base.\n  5. Review the sectors currently prioritized for onshoring or “friendshoring” of manufacturing (kinetic capabilities, castings and forgings, critical materials, microelectronics, space, and electric vehicle batteries); evaluate them according to the strategic landscape; and expand or reprioritize the list as appropriate.\n  6. Help small businesses to become medium-size and large vendors, which encourages a more resilient industrial base and fosters competition. Encourage and plan for durable supply chains for small businesses so they also have commercial/private-sector customers and are not solely dependent on defense orders.\n  7. Increase external engagement among small businesses to inform them of DOD's needs and how they could work with DOD to meet national security priorities.\n\n- **Optimize the DOD acquisition community**.\n  1. Create incentives to emphasize speed and agility in decision-making for prototyping and program-of-record starts and terminations. Most bureaucrats would rather follow a checklist and fail than go outside the procedures and win because failure means negative career repercussions. Senior acquisition leaders should design a system that allows decision-makers to stay within the law but bypass unnecessary departmental regulations that hamper the acquisition of capabilities that warfighters require.\n  2. The Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition and Sustainment, Under Secretary for Research and Engineering, and all service secretaries should assess their acquisition workforces; determine what additional personnel, resources, and training they need; and develop implementation plans. The goal is to develop, prototype, acquire, and field required capabilities at the speed of relevance to meet America's pacing threats and maintain a warfighting advantage.\n  3. Decentralize Defense Acquisition University (DAU) offerings and expand the DAU mission to include accreditation of non-DOD institutions. The critical shortage of trained and certified acquisition personnel must be addressed with urgency in order to support DOD mission objectives and goals. With the rapid evolution of training and educational technologies, including remote and virtual practices, there is no reason for DAU to maintain a monopoly on the knowledge and certification that are required to perform as acquisition professionals.\n  4. Encourage contractors and non-DOD civilians who aspire to such roles by making certifications more accessible and affordable.\n\n### DOD RESEARCH, DEVELOPMENT, TEST, AND EVALUATION (RDT&E)\n\nThe FY 2017 National Defense Authorization Act established the position of Under Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering and assigned broad responsibility for “all defense research and engineering, technology development, technology transition, prototyping, experimentation, and developmental testing activities and programs, including the allocation of resources for defense research and engineering, and unifying defense research and engineering efforts across the Department,” to the new Under Secretary, who also was tasked with “serving as the principal advisor to the Secretary on all research, engineering, and technology development activities and programs in the Department.” This led to the single largest DOD structural change since the Goldwater–Nichols act of 1986 and was organized effectively during President Donald Trump's Administration.\n\n#### Needed Reforms\n\n- **Champion, engage, and focus the American innovation ecosystem**.\n  1. Engage and leverage all of America's scientific, engineering, and high-tech production communities to research, develop, prototype, and rapidly deploy advanced technology capabilities on a continuing basis to preserve our warfighting advantage.\n  2. Increase integration and collaboration among the DOD, government labs, and private companies to solve the department's most difficult problems.\n  3. Reduce the number of critical technology areas from 14 to a more manageable number to concentrate effort and resources on those that bear directly on great-power competition.\n  4. Rebuild RDT&E infrastructure that resides in Cold War–era facilities and is not well-suited to the current era of rapid development and testing of advanced technology and concepts to the maturity level necessary for acquisition and operational fielding.\n  5. Move toward a much more comprehensive independent risk-reduction approach to increase understanding of the technical risks by drawing on the expertise in DOD laboratories and agencies to help acquisition programs succeed.\n\n- **Improve the rapid deployment of technology to the battlefield**.\n  1. Accelerate the prototyping cycle to meet immediate battlefield needs.\n  2. Require tighter integration with user communities to provide value.\n  3. Establish a pipeline of near-term, mid-term, and long-term technology that is aimed at great-power competition (China) and can be matured, prototyped, and evaluated to support major acquisitions (the ability to produce at scale) to break the cycle of schedule delays and cost overruns from underdeveloped and poorly understood technologies.\n\n- **Develop a framework to protect the RDT&E enterprise from foreign exploitation**. Strategic competition and adaptive adversaries require new thinking about how to protect technology. China has been relentless in stealing U.S. technology, using the full range of measures from influence operations to outright theft. This has been a major factor in its ability to close the gap and in some cases to exceed U.S. capabilities.\n  1. Implement a comprehensive approach to preserving U.S. technological leadership that is based on outpacing our adversaries; clear about what we need to protect; tailored to various specific sectors (for example, academia, the defense industrial base, and laboratories); and underpinned with a full range of consequences for attempted or actual theft.\n\n### DOD FOREIGN MILITARY SALES\n\nThe United States must regain its role as the “Arsenal of Democracy.” In fiscal year (FY) 2021, U.S. government foreign military sales (FMS) nosedived to a low of $34.8 billion from a record high of $55.7 billion in FY 2018. This decrease hinders interoperability with partners and allies, decreases defense industrial base capacity, and increases the taxpayer burden on the U.S. military's own procurements.\n\nUnder previous Administrations, the United States built its reputation as a reliable partner with a strong defense industrial base that could supply military articles and goods in a timely manner. Today's FMS process is encumbered by byzantine bureaucracy, long contracting times, high costs, and mundane technology.\n\nThe United States can change this downward trajectory by improving internal processes that incentivize partners and allies to procure U.S. defense systems, thereby expanding our “defense ecosystem.” We must reverse the recent dip in FMS to ensure both that our partners remain interoperable with the United States and that our defense industrial base regains much-needed capacity in preparation for future challenges.\n\n#### Needed Reforms\n\n- **Emphasize exportability with U.S. procurements**. The record-low FMS sales in 2021 were driven partly by the high costs of converting weapon systems on the back end of production rather than emphasizing exportability in initial capability planning.\n  1. Ensure that senior U.S. military leadership emphasizes exportability in the initial development of defense systems that are both available and interoperable with our partners and allies.\n  2. Create a funding mechanism to incentivize exportability in initial planning, which can be recouped after future FMS transactions.\n\n- **End informal congressional notification**. Informal congressional notification or “tiered review” is a hindrance to ensuring timely sales to our global partners. The tiered review process is not codified in law; it is merely a practice by which the Department of State provides a preview of prospective arms transfers before Congress is formally notified.\n  1. End the tiered review process to eliminate at least 20 days from the FMS process.\n  2. Use the tiered review process only when unanimous congressional support is guaranteed in order to eliminate the “weaponization” by select Members of Congress that has prevented billions of dollars of arms sales from moving into formal congressional notification.\n\n- **Minimize barriers to collaboration**. The high cost of developing advanced defense platforms requires the United States to collaborate with key allies to minimize waste, complement strengths, and supplement our defense industrial base to create a system that is greater than that of the United States alone.\n  1. Enhance defense industrial base planning with partners to allow them to focus on niche areas where there are cost advantages for the United States.\n  2. Decrease International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR) to facilitate trade with such allies as the United Kingdom, Canada, and Australia.\n  3. Create opportunities to improve the health of the defense supply chain with added opportunities for partners and allies to contribute.\n\n- **Reform the FMS contracting process**. The contracting timeline for the FMS process is shockingly slow. On average, the DOD contracting timeline takes approximately 18 months because of slow bureaucratic processes and chronic understaffing.\n  1. Immediately fund more contracting capacity in all services to decrease the contracting timeline and improve the delivery of defense articles to our global partners.\n  2. Rationalize and speed arms sales decision-making to preclude our enemies from exploiting bureaucratic slothfulness and allow us to manage the development of indigenous defense industrial bases.\n\n### DOD PERSONNEL\n\nThe men and women of America's armed forces are the most critical component of our national defense strategy, but in recent years, they have been overextended, undervalued, and insufficiently resourced. Their families help them to carry the burden of service, but the assistance they receive is disproportionately less than the sacrifices they make. Young civilians who would thrive in a military environment are disenfranchised when educators and influencers discourage them from learning about military service and preparing for the honor of wearing America's uniform.\n\nThe United States military is an extraordinary institution, staffed by exceptional people who have defended our nation and changed the course of history, but the Biden Administration, through word and deed, has treated the armed forces as just another place to work. We must restore our military to a place of honor and respect and recruit and retain the individuals who will meet the rigorous standards of excellence that are required for membership in the world's greatest fighting force.\n\n#### Needed Reforms\n\n- **Rescue recruiting and retention**. Recruiting was the worst in 2022 that it has been in two generations and is expected to be even worse in 2023. Some of the problems are self-inflicted and ongoing. The recruiting problem is not service-specific: It affects the entire Joint Force.\n  1. Appoint a Special Assistant to the President who will maintain liaison with Congress, DOD, and all other interested parties on the issue of recruiting and retention.\n  2. Improve recruiting by suspending the use of the recently introduced MHS Genesis system that uses private medical records of potential recruits at Military Entrance Processing Stations (MEPS), creating unnecessary delays and unwarranted rejections.\n  3. Improve military recruiters' access to secondary schools and require completion of the Armed Services Vocational Aptitude Battery (ASVAB)—the military entrance examination—by all students in schools that receive federal funding.\n  4. Encourage Members of Congress to provide time to military recruiters during each townhall session in their congressional districts.\n  5. Increase the number of Junior ROTC programs in secondary schools.\n\n- **Restore standards of lethality and excellence**. Entrance criteria for military service and specific occupational career fields should be based on the needs of those positions. Exceptions for individuals who are already predisposed to require medical treatment (for example, HIV positive or suffering from gender dysphoria) should be removed, and those with gender dysphoria should be expelled from military service. Physical fitness requirements should be based on the occupational field without consideration of gender, race, ethnicity, or orientation.\n\n- **Eliminate politicization, reestablish trust and accountability, and restore faith to the force**. In 2021, the Reagan National Defense Survey found that only 45 percent of Americans have “a great deal of trust and confidence in the military”—down from 70 percent in 2018.\n  1. Strengthen protections for chaplains to carry out their ministry according to the tenets of their faith.\n  2. Codify language to instruct senior military officers (three and four stars) to make certain that they understand their primary duty to be ensuring the readiness of the armed forces, not pursuing a social engineering agenda. This direction should be reinforced during the Senate confirmation process. Orders and direction motivated by purely partisan motives should be identified as threats to readiness.\n  3. Reinstate servicemembers to active duty who were discharged for not receiving the COVID vaccine, restore their appropriate rank, and provide back pay.\n  4. Eliminate Marxist indoctrination and divisive critical race theory programs and abolish newly established diversity, equity, and inclusion offices and staff.\n  5. Restrict the use of social media solely for purposes of recruitment and discipline any armed services personnel who use an official command channel to engage with civilian critics on social media.\n  6. Audit the course offerings at military academies to remove Marxist indoctrination, eliminate tenure for academic professionals, and apply the same rules to instructors that are applied to other DOD contracting personnel.\n  7. Reverse policies that allow transgender individuals to serve in the military. Gender dysphoria is incompatible with the demands of military service, and the use of public monies for transgender surgeries or to facilitate abortion for servicemembers should be ended.\n\n- **Value the military family**. Military service requires extreme sacrifices by families.\n  1. Support legislation to increase wages and family allowances for active-duty enlisted personnel. No uniformed personnel should ever have to rely on social benefits like as food stamps or public housing assistance.\n  2. Improve base housing and consider the military family holistically when considering change-of-station moves.\n  3. Improve spouse employment opportunities and protections, including licensing reform, and expand childcare.\n  4. Audit all curricula and health policies in DOD schools for military families, remove all inappropriate materials, and reverse inappropriate policies.\n  5. Support legislation giving education savings account options to military families.\n\n- **Reduce the number of generals**. Rank creep is pervasive. The number of O-6 to O-9 officers is at an all-time high across the armed services (above World War II levels), and the actual battlefield experience of this officer corps is at an all-time low. The next President should limit the continued advancement of many of the existing cadre, many of whom have been advanced by prior Administrations for reasons other than their warfighting prowess.\n\n### DOD INTELLIGENCE\n\nOur national defense establishment must evolve to meet the rapid, profound, and dynamic change in the global landscape, but absent significant effort to evaluate and retool in critical areas—including our intelligence and security portfolios—America's competitive advantage against rivals and adversaries is at serious risk. However, for any structural changes to succeed, the crisis in our Intelligence Community (IC)/Defense Intelligence Enterprise (DIE) leadership must be addressed.\n\nThe DIE accounts for the bulk of the Intelligence Community's personnel and a significant portion of its budget. Of the IC's 17 elements, eight are within DOD, two are independent, and seven belong to various other departments and agencies. Overall, “[t]he DoD provides 86 percent of the personnel who conduct intelligence activities, both military and civilian.”\n\nThe Defense Intelligence Enterprise must deliver accurate, unbiased, and timely insights consistently and with clarity, objectivity, and independence. If they continue on their current path, however, both the DIE and the Intelligence Community writ large will continue to provide inaccurate and politicized intelligence assessments that mislead policymakers.\n\n#### Needed Reforms\n\n- **Improve the intelligence process**. Defense intelligence assets have been committed to the prosecution of operational campaigns since September 11, 2001, at the expense of our strategic objectives, and this has led to increased risk. Further, the DIE has evolved into a “customer-based” model with the DIE/IC trying to be supportive of policy direction at the expense of analytical integrity. The result has been a significant politicization of intelligence.\n  1. Establish unbiased intelligence reporting from DIE/IC senior leaders. As the leader of the DIE, the Under Secretary of Defense for Intelligence and Security should provide a top-line, dissenting, or clarifying view of DIE and IC assessments as needed.\n  2. Align collection and analysis with vital national interests (countering China and Russia).\n  3. Establish an effective global federated intelligence framework with allies and partners and our Combatant Commands. Avoid the temptation to neglect areas that appear less pertinent but that support a convergence of threats and the critical requirements to sustain those threats.\n  4. Establish and sustain feedback loops to provide insight and direction for continuous improvement and accountability. We must revisit our assessments and understand where we got it right and where we got it wrong.\n  5. Better exploit publicly available information (PAI) data and foster innovation to improve collection and analysis. We must end the practice of multiple DIE organizations paying to acquire the same PAI data and invest more in machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) to exploit open-source and classified intelligence data.\n  6. Remove policy obstacles that impede available technical solutions and tailored approaches in order to preclude corruption at the point of collection.\n  7. Develop statistical discrimination techniques based on relative value to deal with the volume and velocity of available data and information, which are rapidly exceeding our ability to exploit and analyze available data and information efficiently.\n\n- **Expand the integration of intelligence activities**. The prevalence of asymmetric warfare requires Defense Intelligence to leverage the unique authorities and capabilities of U.S. departments and agencies, as well as our partners and allies, to competitive advantage.\n  1. Create an improved cyber defense and capability. We must reevaluate the dual-hat structure between the National Security Agency (NSA) and U.S. Cyber Command (USCYBERCOM).\n  2. Resurrect economic analysis capability to improve our ability to counter Chinese whole-of-government strategies that combine security with predatory economic objectives.\n  3. Resurrect critical thinking to provide true strategic intelligence that will enable the U.S. to counter global adversaries and emerging technologies (such as adversary advances in hypersonics, Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS), cyber domain, advanced fighter aircraft, and advanced undersea capabilities) more effectively.\n  4. Rebuild human intelligence (HUMINT) and counterintelligence (CI) and improve their integration with defensive and offensive cyber operations.\n  5. Establish true alignment between DOD and DHS both to improve the defense of critical U.S. infrastructure and national border integrity and to develop vital information that enables defense against foreign targeted disruptions.\n\n- **Restore accountability and public trust**. In recent years, public trust in Defense Intelligence has been eroded by, for example, flawed assumptions leading up to our Afghanistan withdrawal, flawed Russia–Ukraine assessments, divergences in relations with key Gulf allies, and voids being filled by Russia and China around the world. For trust to be restored and sustained, officials must be held accountable.\n  1. Restore DIE critical thinking. Establish mechanisms to restore analytic integrity and return to true intelligence-driven operations. The next Administration should eliminate the conflict of interest in the current customer-based model (in which the customer is always right) by enforcing time-tested procedures that guarantee independent analysis, even if it means challenging policymakers' assumptions. The Under Secretary of Defense for Intelligence and Security's leadership role should be expanded to include providing analytic top-line views and improve DIE transparency by highlighting diverging views.\n  2. Elevate the DIE's voice in national policy discussions, commensurate with the DIE's 75 percent share of the IC budget. Present defense intelligence to senior policymakers, either independently to avoid all-source bias or in consensus products like the National Intelligence Estimates.\n\n- **Eliminate peripheral intelligence obligations that do not advance military readiness**. In 2019, following the catastrophic 2015 data breach at the U.S. Office of Personnel Management (OPM), the Defense Counterintelligence and Security Agency (DCSA) accepted transfer of the responsibility to conduct security clearance and suitability investigations for 95 percent of the U.S. government's civilian workforce. This decision, which grew out of an intention to deconstruct OPM, was wrongheaded on many levels and made the federal bureaucracy dependent on a new overlay of DOD bureaucracy, in a sense instilling DOD control of civilian managers. This function should be returned to OPM except for military security clearance investigations.\n\n### U.S. ARMY\n\nThe U.S. Army's mission is “[t]o deploy, fight and win our nation's wars by providing ready, prompt and sustained land dominance by Army forces across the full spectrum of conflict as part of the joint force.” Today, however, the Army cannot execute its land dominance mission. The U.S. Army is at an inflection point that is marked by more than a decade of steadily eroding budgets and diluted buying power, an appreciable degradation in readiness and training capacity, a near crisis in the recruiting and retention of critical personnel, and a bevy of aging weapons systems that no longer provide a qualitative edge over peer and near-peer competitors but will not be replaced in the near term.\n\nAll of these challenges are set against the backdrop of a complex and dynamic global geopolitical environment that is exemplified and exacerbated by the triumph of our adversaries in Afghanistan after a 20-year struggle there as well as recent Russian outrages in Ukraine and China's bellicosity both on its borders and in surrounding disputed regions. In spite of these ever-increasing operational pulls, our Army is consistently being asked to do more with fewer resources. The status quo is further marked by a pervasive politically driven top-down focus on progressive social policies that emphasize matters like so-called diversity, equity, and inclusion and climate change, often to the detriment of the Army's core warfighting mission.\n\n#### Needed Reforms\n\n- **Rebuild the Army**. The total Army budget has decreased by roughly 11 percent since 2018, perilously affecting the service's readiness and ability to train and to procure new personnel and equipment. Declining budgets and decreased buying power have forced the Army to lower training standards and opportunities to train, propose reductions in end strength, slash military construction programs to historically low levels, and scale back essential modernization programs.\n  1. Increase the Army budget to remain the world's preeminent land power.\n  2. Accelerate the development and procurement of the six current Army modernization priorities (long-range precision fires, the Next-Generation Combat Vehicle, Future Vertical Lift, the Army network, air and missile defense, and soldier lethality) to replace worn out and outdated combat systems and ensure ground combat dominance.\n  3. Increase funding to improve Army training and operational readiness.\n  4. Increase the Army force structure by 50,000 to handle two major regional contingencies simultaneously.\n\n- **Focus on deployability and sustained operations**. The U.S. Army's very lethal ground force capability is irrelevant if it cannot quickly deploy to locations for employment in decisive operations to secure our global security interests. Additionally, Army logisticians provide the ground transportation (of both personnel and equipment); fuel, food, and water; munitions (bombs and bullets); medical supplies and services; and veterinary services (food safety) that are critical to sustainment of the other services.\n  1. Immediately increase the production and stockpiling of critical munitions and repair parts.\n  2. Prioritize expeditionary logistics in all force design and operational planning to guarantee entry into a contested theater of war.\n  3. Increase the level of Joint Force training, synchronization, and coordination focused on logistics.\n  4. Prepare to deploy forces from degraded U.S.-based transportation infrastructure that is compromised by opposing forces.\n\n- **Transform Army culture and training**. The Army can no longer serve as the nation's social testing ground. A rebuilt Army that is focused again on its core warfighting mission and empowered it with the tools, resources, and authorities it needs to accomplish that mission must be the next Administration's highest defense priority.\n  1. Stop using the Army as a test bed for social evolution. Misusing the Army in this way detracts from its core purpose while doing little to reshape the American social structure. The Army no longer reflects national demographics to the degree that it did before 1974 when the draft was eliminated.\n  2. Demand accountability in senior leaders to reverse the decline in public support for military service.\n  3. Reestablish the experiential base for the planning, execution, and leadership of Army formations in large-scale operations. Currently, there are no general or field-grade officers who served as planners or commanders against a near-peer adversary in combat.\n  4. Examine the logic of emerging Army concepts about employing massed long-range fires and effects without considering how to gain advantage by closing with and dominating an adversary on land.\n  5. Recognize that high-intensity land combat operations cannot be sustained through short-term individual or unit rotations in the style of the sustained low-intensity campaigns conducted over the past 20 years.\n  6. Transform how the National Guard is employed during extended operations short of declared war to preclude back-to-back federal and state deployments of National Guard soldiers in order to stabilize and preserve military volunteerism in our communities.\n  7. Revamp Army school curricula to concentrate on preparation for large-scale land operations that focus on defeating a peer threat.\n  8. Address the underlying causal issues driving increasing Army suicide rates, which have surpassed pre–World War II rates and are now eclipsing the rate among civilians.\n\n### U.S. NAVY\n\nAs noted at the beginning of this chapter, the U.S. Constitution gives Congress the power to “provide and maintain a Navy.” Inherent in this phrase is a recognition that there is a vital national interest in the maritime environment and that this national interest requires sustained planning and investment. This is as true today as it was almost 250 years ago and will remain true into the future.\n\nThe U.S. Navy (USN) exists for two primary reasons: to project prompt, sustained, and effective combat power globally, both at sea and ashore, and to deter aggression by potential adversaries by maintaining a forward operating presence in conjunction with allies and partners. Today, the People's Republic of China People's Liberation Army Navy (PLAN) can challenge the USN's ability to accomplish its mission in the Pacific and Indian Oceans.\n\nIn the production, employment, and control of maritime forces, the USN must consider the scope and rate of technological change and, where appropriate, adapt its processes and workforce development. In balancing the necessary long-term industrial model of naval platforms against emerging short-term opportunities, the USN must take account of advances that may present vulnerabilities and risks as well as what is assured and secure.\n\n#### Needed Reforms\n\n- **Invest in and expand force structure**. The USN's organizing principle remains platform-centered: vessels manned by sailors. The manned surface and subsurface forces act in concert with land-based, air-based, and space-based forces to project power outside sovereign territory, principally by operating in international waters. Investments must be closely coordinated with these other elements of military power.\n  1. Build a fleet of more than 355 ships.\n  2. Develop and field unmanned systems to augment the manned forces.\n  3. Require that range and lethality be the key factors in all procurement and sustainment decisions for ships, aircraft, and munitions.\n\n- **Reestablish the General Board**. In contrast with the Navy General Board that served ship development so well during the interwar period, the current joint process for defining the requirements for major defense acquisitions is not well-suited to long-term planning of the sort that is needed for USN fleet architecture and shipbuilding. The interwar General Board should serve as a model, empowered with final decision authority over all requirements documents concerning ships and the major defense systems fielded on ships. The individual board members would ensure a broad base of knowledge as well as independent thinking.\n  \n- **Establish a Rapid Capabilities Office**. The USN must transition technology into warfighting capability more rapidly. It must foster a culture of innovation that includes connecting theoretical and intangible ideas with real production environments that produce tangible and practical outcomes and adapting proven processes to advance material solutions.\n  1. Harness innovation and willingness to tolerate risk so that “good enough” systems can be fielded rapidly.\n  2. Use the Space Development Agency as a model.\n  3. Establish an oversight Board of Directors made up of the service chief, service secretary, and Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition and Sustainment.\n\n- **Accelerate the purchase of key munitions**. It takes years to build and maintain navies but only hours to expend their ordnance in combat. The USN must be prepared to expend large quantities of air-launched and sea-launched stealthy, precision, cruise missiles against targets both at sea and ashore. Additionally, modern air defense requires the use of high-performance surface-to-air missiles.\n  1. Produce key munitions at the maximum rate with significant capacity.\n  2. Working with the Congress, employ the widest possible range of techniques to enhance the munitions supply chains and workforce.\n\n- **Enhance warfighter development**. The USN requires a variety of documented qualifications for personnel to advance in their careers and assume leadership positions. It also requires individual professional qualifications that are focused on warfighting.\n  1. Mandate qualifications that demonstrate an understanding of core competence in collective, integrated warfighting, especially based on current plans and technologies.\n  2. Elevate the Headquarters Staff focused on Warfighter Development (N7) within the Office of the Chief of Naval Operations (OPNAV) and empower it to develop such requirements.\n  3. Require that war games be utilized as experiential learning environments for the participants as a prerequisite for achieving career milestones (department heads, commanding officers, and major commanders).\n  4. Highlight in training and leader development that USN forces can and must maintain the ability to operate from and/or defend sovereign territory to include our allies and partners.\n  5. Train to balance effects from kinetic to nonkinetic and from lethal to nonlethal through effective command and control.\n\n### U.S. MARINE CORPS\n\nThe U.S. Marine Corps (USMC) is the maritime land force of the Department of Defense and Department of the Navy. It serves a critical role as an expeditionary amphibious force that can project power from sea to shore and beyond while performing other specialized missions like securing America's diplomatic outposts abroad.\n\nBetween the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, and the conclusion of U.S. military operations in Afghanistan in August 2022, the Marine Corps engaged in extended operations ashore as directed by the Secretary of Defense, leaving it with little opportunity or ability to train for and execute the naval and amphibious operations for which it is uniquely suited and directed by law. This lengthy divergence from its primary mission led to deep concern that the Corps had become a “second land army,” prompting senior Marine Corps leaders to push for the service to return to the sea. In addition, the USMC spent nearly two decades fighting counterinsurgency wars in Afghanistan and Iraq and developed capabilities that were specifically geared to those fights but have limited utility in scenarios involving evenly matched and advanced enemies or amphibious operations that are necessary for the projection of naval power.\n\nAs a result, Marine Corps Commandant General David H. Berger developed and began to implement Force Design 2030, a plan that, if completed, would be the most radical transformation of the Marine Corps since World War II. The successful implementation of this force redesign, coupled with reforms in the Marine Corps' personnel system and the Navy's amphibious shipbuilding plans, will be critical to ensuring the Corps' future combat effectiveness.\n\n#### Needed Reforms\n\n- **Divest systems to implement the Force Design 2030 transformation**. Divesting equipment that is less relevant to distributed, low-signature operations in a contested maritime environment will make funds available for modernization.\n  1. Transform USMC force structure.\n     - Eliminate all USMC law enforcement battalions.\n     - Transform at least one Marine Infantry Regiment into a Marine Littoral Regiment.\n     - Reduce the size of remaining infantry battalions.\n  2. Divest systems or equipment that are better suited to heavier U.S. Army units.\n     - Maintain divestment of M1 Abrams tanks.\n     - Eliminate the majority of tube artillery (M777) batteries.\n     - Reduce the number of Advanced Amphibious Assault Vehicles and the number of their replacements.\n  3. Use funds made available by divestment of systems to support new systems that are geared to the likely needs of future conflicts.\n     - Increase the number of rocket artillery batteries (HIMARS).\n     - Increase the number of upgraded Light Armored Vehicle (LAV) companies.\n     - Increase the number of Unmanned Aerial Systems and anti-air systems (including counter-UAS systems).\n     - Develop long-range strike missiles and anti-ship missiles for the Corps.\n     - Modernize USMC infantry equipment.\n\n- **Transform the USMC personnel paradigm**. More than other services, the USMC relies heavily on junior noncommissioned officers (NCOs) to staff key positions across the force but especially in combat arms. For example, E-4s routinely hold squad leader billets when the Army normally has E-6s in those billets. The nature of more distributed operations and the increasingly complex responsibilities of a Marine Corps rifle squad and platoon under Force Design 2030 will only put more responsibility on the backs of squad leaders and platoon sergeants, increasing the need for more senior Marines in those critical positions. Additionally, the Corps needs to improve its retention of junior NCOs after their first enlistments (the Marines have much lower rates of reenlistment than other branches).\n  1. Align the USMC's combat arms rank structure with the U.S. Army's (squad leader billets are for E-6s, and platoon sergeant billets are for E-7s).\n  2. Create better incentives to retain talented junior NCOs, especially in infantry and other critical military occupational specialties.\n  3. Reduce unnecessary deployments to increase dwell time in order to enable more robust primary military education.\n\n- **Align Navy amphibious shipbuilding with Force Design 2030**. The U.S. Navy has struggled for decades to maintain an amphibious fleet that could support USMC war plans around large-scale amphibious operations. In addition, amphibious shipbuilding has often had to compete against other priorities within a constrained budget and limited shipbuilding capacity.\n  1. Develop and produce light amphibious warships (LAWs) to support more distributed amphibious operations, especially in the Pacific.\n  2. Maintain between 28 and 31 larger amphibious warships as opposed to the 25 specified in current Navy shipbuilding plans and the 38 specified before 2020.\n\n### U.S. SPACE FORCE\n\nU.S. space forces conduct global space operations to sustain and enhance air, land, and sea effectiveness, lethality, and superiority by providing secure broadband global communications (precision position, navigation, and timing accuracy); attack warning and threat tracking and targeting capability (real-time intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance information); and their assured continuity of operations both by defending U.S. assets and by conducting offensive operations that are capable of imposing unacceptable losses on adversaries that might seek to attack them.\n\nThe U.S. Space Force (USSF) was established to assure continuous global and theater combat support from space, to deter attacks against U.S. space assets, and to prevail in space should deterrence fail. The USSF posture was conceived as a balance of offensive and defensive deterrent capabilities designed for maximum effectiveness.\n\n#### Needed Reforms\n\n- **Reverse the Biden Administration's defensive posture**. The Biden Administration has eliminated almost all offensive deterrence capabilities and instead will rely solely on defensive capabilities of disaggregation, maneuver, and reconstitution—the most costly, the slowest, and ultimately the most fragile architecture selection.\n  1. Reestablish offensive capabilities to guarantee a favorable balance of forces, efficiently manage the full deterrence spectrum, and seriously complicate enemy calculations of a successful first strike against U.S. space assets.\n  2. Restore architectural balance in U.S. space forces, both offensive and defensive, to restore deterrence dominance efficiently and quickly.\n  3. Rapidly expand space control capability, to include cis-lunar space (the region beginning at geosynchronous altitude and encompassing the moon), to provide early warning of an enemy attack.\n  4. Seek arms control and “rules of the road” understandings only when they are unambiguously in the interests of the U.S. and its allies, and prohibit their unilateral implementation.\n\n- **Reduce overclassification**. The USSF must move beyond the Cold War–era culture of secrecy and overclassification that surrounded military space to facilitate greater coordination and synchronization of efforts across the government and commercial sectors.\n  \n  - Declassify appropriate information about terrestrial and on-orbit space capabilities that threaten the U.S. space constellation, as well as those being pursued by our competitors, to secure the principled right to counter them offensively.\n\n- **Implement policies suited to a mature USSF**. No longer a “newborn,” the USSF has entered its fourth year of existence, and the lessons learned can be incorporated across all facets of the force to increase its effectiveness.\n  1. Restructure from the current “unity of effort” structure to “unity of command.”\n  2. Lead the U.S. government's development of a clear and unambiguous declaratory policy that the United States will operate at will in space and enforce these operations with capabilities that ensure effective deterrence and the ability to impose our will if necessary.\n  3. End the current study phase of concept development and issue necessary guidance for the development and fielding of offensive capabilities.\n  4. Alter the Space Development Agency's current “fail-early” approach and transition to a methodology that maintains aggressive timelines but with significantly greater engineering rigor, with special attention to sustainment, support, and fully integrated space operations.\n  5. Increase the number of general officer positions to ensure the Space Force's ability to compete for resources on a common basis with the other services.\n  6. Explore creation of a Space Force Academy to attract top aero–astro students, engineers, and scientists and develop astronauts. The academy could be attached initially to a large existing research university like the California Institute of Technology or MIT, share faculty and funding, and eventually be built separately to be on par with the other service academies.\n\n### U.S. CYBER COMMAND\n\nUSCYBERCOM was established in 2010 by the Department of Defense to unify the direction of cyberspace operations, strengthen DOD cyberspace capabilities, and integrate and enhance U.S. cyber expertise. Cyber capabilities and threats are evolving rapidly. Accordingly, a conservative Administration should be especially sensitive to and prepared to meet the challenges presented by bureaucratic silos, inappropriately rigid tactical doctrine, and strategic thinking's historic tendency to lag behind technological capability.\n\nThe preliminary evidence from the war in Ukraine suggests that existing cyber doctrine and certain capability and target assumptions may be incorrect or misplaced. The following recommendations therefore presuppose that there will be a rigorous “lessons learned” analysis and review of existing U.S. doctrine in light of the battlefield evidence.\n\n#### Needed Reforms\n\n- **Ensure that USCYBERCOM is properly focused**. Mission creep is leading to wasteful overlap with the Department of Homeland Security, National Security Agency, Department of Defense, and Central Intelligence Agency.\n  1. Separate USCYBERCOM from the National Security Agency per congressional direction.\n  2. Conduct effective offensive cyber-effects operations at the tactical and strategic levels.\n  3. Expand defensive cyber-effects operations authorized by President Trump's classified National Security Presidential Memorandum 13, “United States Cyber Operations Policy.”\n  4. End USCYBERCOM's participation in federal efforts to “fortify” U.S. elections to eliminate the perception that DOD is engaging in partisan politics.\n\n- **Increase USCYBERCOM's effectiveness**.\n  1. Accelerate the integration of cyber and electronic warfare (EW) doctrine and capabilities, abiding by the time-tested norms of combined-arms warfare.\n  2. Mandate that development teams will include both coders and soldiers, aircrew, and sailors with kinetic experience at the platoon level.\n  3. Break the paradigm of cyber authorities held at the strategic level.\n  4. Increase cyber resilience by, for example, protecting the Nuclear Command, Control, and Communications Network and the Air Force's Cyber Resiliency Office for Weapons Systems (CROWS).\n  5. Expand coordination of joint operations with allies.\n  6. Implement the Government Accountability Office's recommendation that the DOD Chief Information Officer, Commander of USCYBERCOM, and Commander of Joint Force Headquarters–DOD Information Network “align policy and system requirements to enable DOD to have enterprise-wide visibility of cyber incident reporting to support tactical, strategic, and military strategies for response.”\n\n- **Rationalize strategy and doctrine**.\n  1. Update the October 2022 National Security Strategy to define DOD roles and responsibilities beyond existing platitudes.\n  2. Apply traditional deterrence strategies and principles for using cyber/EW in retaliation for foreign cyberattacks and/or EW actions against U.S. infrastructure and citizens.\n\n### SPECIAL OPERATIONS FORCES\n\nEven though America's conventional war in Afghanistan was a failure, Special Operations Forces of the United States Special Operations Command (USSOCOM) executed an extremely effective counterterrorism campaign: There has not been another major attack on the homeland, global terrorist threats are reduced and managed, collaboration with international partners is effective, and units under USSOCOM are the most capable and experienced warfighters in two generations.\n\nThere is a movement to reduce the scope and scale of USSOCOM's mission in favor of other service priorities in great-power competition. This would be a mistake because USSOCOM can be employed effectively in great-power competition. It makes sense to capitalize on USSOCOM's experience and repurpose its mission to include irregular warfare within the context of great-power competition, thereby providing a robust organization that is capable of achieving strategic effects that are critical both to our national defense and to the defense of our allies and partners around the globe. Irregular warfare should be used proactively to prevent state and nonstate actors from negatively affecting U.S. policies and objectives while simultaneously strengthening our regional partnerships. If we maintain irregular warfare's traditional focus on nonstate actors, we limit ourselves to addressing only the symptoms (nonstate actors), not the problems themselves (China, Russia, North Korea, and Iran).\n\n#### Needed Reforms\n\n- **Make irregular warfare a cornerstone of security strategy**. The U.S. can project strength through unified action with our Interagency, allies, and partners by utilizing irregular warfare capabilities synchronized with elements of national power. Broadly redefining irregular warfare to address current state and nonstate actors is critical to countering irregular threats that range from the Chinese use of economic warfare to Russian disinformation and Islamist terrorism. A broad definition of irregular warfare in the National Security Strategy would allow for a whole-of-government approach, thereby providing resources and capabilities to counter threats and ultimately serve as credible deterrence at the strategic and tactical levels.\n  1. Define irregular warfare as “a means by which the United States uses all elements of national power to project influence abroad to counter state adversaries, defeat hostile nonstate actors, deter wider conflict, and maintain peace in great-power competition.”\n  2. Characterize the state and nonstate irregular threats facing the U.S. by region in the National Security Strategy.\n  3. Direct that irregular warfare resources, capabilities, and strategies be incorporated directly into the overall National Defense Strategy instead of being relegated to a supporting document.\n  4. Establish an Irregular Warfare Center of Excellence to help DOD train, equip, and organize to conduct irregular warfare as a core competency across the spectrum of competition, crisis, and conflict.\n\n- **Counter China's Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) globally**. DOD, in conjunction with the Interagency, allies, and partner nations, must work proactively to counter China's BRI around the globe.\n  1. Task USSOCOM and corresponding organizations in the Pentagon with conceptualizing, resourcing, and executing regionally based operations to counter the BRI with a focus on nations that are key to our energy policy, international supply chains, and our defense industrial base.\n  2. Use regional and global information operations to highlight Chinese violations of Exclusive Economic Zones, violations of human rights, and coercion along Chinese fault lines in Xinjiang Province, Hong Kong, and Taiwan in addition to China's weaponization of sovereign debt.\n  3. Directly counter Chinese economic power with all elements of national power in North America, Central America, and the Caribbean to maintain maritime freedom of movement and protect the digital infrastructure of nations in the region.\n\n- **Establish credible deterrence through irregular warfare to protect the homeland**. A whole-of-government approach and willingness to employ cyber, information, economic, and counterterrorist irregular warfare capabilities should be utilized to protect the homeland.\n  1. Include the designation of USSOCOM as lead for the execution of irregular warfare against hostile state and nonstate actors in the National Defense Strategy.\n  2. Demonstrate a willingness to employ offensive cyber capabilities against adversaries who conduct cyberattacks against U.S. infrastructure, businesses, personnel, and governments.\n  3. Employ a “name and shame” approach by making information regarding the names of entities that target democratic processes and international norms available in a transparent manner.\n  4. Work with the Interagency to employ economic warfare, lawfare, and diplomatic pressure against hostile state and nonstate actors.\n  5. Maintain the authorities necessary for an aggressive counterterrorism posture against threats to the homeland.\n\n### NUCLEAR DETERRENCE\n\nNuclear deterrence is one of the most critical elements of U.S. national security, as it forms a backstop to U.S. military forces. Every operational plan relies on the assumption that nuclear deterrence holds. Ever since the U.S. first acquired nuclear weapons, Administrations of both parties have pursued a strategy designed to deter nuclear and non-nuclear attack; assure allies; and, in the event of nuclear employment, restore deterrence at the lowest possible cost to the U.S. Today, however, America's ability to meet these goals is increasingly challenged by the growing nuclear threats posed by our adversaries.\n\n- China is pursuing a strategic breakout of its nuclear forces, significantly shifting the nuclear balance and forcing the U.S. to learn how to deter two nuclear peer competitors (China and Russia) simultaneously for the first time in its history.\n- Russia is expanding its nuclear arsenal and using the threat of nuclear employment as a coercive tactic in its war on Ukraine.\n- North Korea is advancing its nuclear capabilities.\n- Iran is inching closer to nuclear capability.\n\nMeanwhile, all U.S. nuclear capabilities and the infrastructure on which they rely date from the Cold War and are in dire need of replacement. The next Administration will need to focus on continuing the effort to modernize the nuclear triad while updating our strategy and capabilities to meet the challenges presented by a more threatening nuclear environment.\n\n#### Needed Reforms\n\n- **Prioritize nuclear modernization**. All components of the nuclear triad are far beyond their intended lifetimes and will need to be replaced over the next decade. This effort is required for the U.S. to maintain its nuclear triad—and will be the bare minimum needed to maintain U.S. strategic nuclear deterrence.\n  1. Accelerate the timelines of critical modernization programs including the Sentinel missile, Long Range Standoff Weapon (LRSO), Columbia-class ballistic missile submarine, B-21 bomber, and F-35 Dual Capable Aircraft.\n  2. Reject any congressional proposals that would further extend the service lives of U.S. capabilities such as the Minuteman III ICBM.\n  3. Ensure sufficient funding for warhead life extension programs (LEP), including the B61-12, W80-4, W87-1 Mod, and W88 Alt 370.\n\n- **Develop the Sea-Launched Cruise Missile-Nuclear (SLCM-N)**. In 2018, the Trump Administration proposed restoring the SLCM-N to help fill a growing gap in U.S. nonstrategic capabilities and improve deterrence against limited nuclear attack. The Biden Administration canceled this program in its 2022 Nuclear Posture Review (NPR). The next President should support and accelerate funding for development of the SLCM-N with the goal of deployment by the end of the decade.\n\n- **Account for China's nuclear expansion**. To ensure its ability to deter both Russia and the growing Chinese nuclear threat, the U.S. will need more than the bare minimum of nuclear modernization. President Biden's 2022 NPR described the problem but proposed no recommendations to restore or maintain nuclear deterrence.\n  1. Consider procuring more modernized nuclear systems (such as the Sentinel missile or LRSO) than currently planned.\n  2. Improve the ability of the U.S. to utilize the triad's upload capacity in case of a crisis.\n  3. Review what capabilities in addition to the SLCM-N (for example, nonstrategic weapons or new warhead designs) are needed to deter the unique Chinese threat.\n\n- **Restore the nuclear infrastructure**. The United States must restore its necessary nuclear infrastructure so that it is capable of producing and maintaining nuclear weapons.\n  1. Accelerate the effort to restore plutonium pit production, which is essential both for modern warhead programs and for recapitalizing the stockpile.\n  2. Continue to invest in rebuilding infrastructure, including facilities at the National Laboratories that support nuclear weapons development.\n  3. Restore readiness to test nuclear weapons at the Nevada National Security Site to ensure the ability of the U.S. to respond quickly to asymmetric technology surprises.\n\n- **Correctly orient arms control**. The U.S. should agree to arms control agreements only if they help to advance the interests of the U.S. and its allies.\n  1. Reject proposals for nuclear disarmament that are contrary to the goal of bolstering deterrence.\n  2. Pursue arms control as a way to secure the national security interests of the U.S. and its allies rather than as an end in itself.\n  3. Prepare to compete in order to secure U.S. interests should arms control efforts continue to fail.\n\n### MISSILE DEFENSE\n\nMissile defense is a critical component of the U.S. national security architecture. It can help to deter attack by instilling doubt that an attack will work as intended, take adversary “cheap shots” off the table, and limit the perceived value of missiles as tools of coercion. It also allows space for diplomacy during a crisis and can protect U.S. and allied forces, critical assets, and populations if deterrence fails. Adversaries are relying increasingly on missiles to achieve their aims.\n\n- China and Russia, in addition to their vast and growing ballistic missile inventories, are deploying new hypersonic glide vehicles and investing in new ground-launched, air-launched, and sea-launched cruise missiles that uniquely challenge the United States in different domains.\n- North Korea has pursued an aggressive missile testing program and is becoming increasingly belligerent toward South Korea and Japan.\n- Iran continues to maintain a missile arsenal that is capable of striking U.S. and allied assets in the Middle East and Europe, and its rocket launches demonstrate that it either has or is developing the ability to build ICBMs.\n\nMissile defense has been underprioritized and underfunded in recent years. In light of these growing threats, the incoming Administration should treat missile defense as a top priority.\n\n#### Needed Reforms\n\n- **Champion the benefits of missile defense**. Despite its deterrence and damage-limitation benefits, opponents argue incorrectly that U.S. missile defense is destabilizing because it threatens Russian and Chinese second-strike capabilities.\n  1. Reject claims made by the Left that missile defense is destabilizing while acknowledging that Russia and China are developing their own advanced missile defense systems.\n  2. Commit to keeping homeland missile defense off the table in any arms control negotiations with Russia and China.\n\n- **Strengthen homeland ballistic missile defense**. The United States currently deploys 44 Ground-Based Interceptors (GBIs) as part of its Ground-based Midcourse Defense (GMD) system to defend the homeland against North Korea, but as North Korea improves its missile program, this system is at risk of falling behind the threat.\n  1. Buy at least 64 of the Next Generation Interceptor (NGI), which is more advanced than the GBI, for an eventual uniform fleet of interceptors. The Biden Administration currently plans to buy only 20.\n  2. Consider additional steps to strengthen the GMD system such as a layered missile defense or a third interceptor site on the East Coast.\n\n- **Increase the development of regional missile defense**. As the Ukraine conflict amply demonstrates, U.S. regional missile defense capabilities are very limited. The United States has been unable to supply our partners reliably with any capabilities, and the number and types of regional missile defense platforms are less than the U.S. needs for its own defense. The U.S. should prioritize procurement of more regional defense systems such as Theater High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD), Standard Missile-3, and Patriot missiles.\n\n- **Change U.S. missile defense policy**. Historically, the U.S. has chosen to rely solely on deterrence to address the Russian and Chinese ballistic missile threat to the homeland and to use homeland missile defense only against rogue nations.\n  1. Abandon the existing policy of not defending the homeland against Russian and Chinese ballistic missiles and focus on how to improve defense as the Russian and Chinese missile threats increase at an unprecedented rate.\n  2. Invest in future advanced missile defense technologies like directed energy or space-based missile defense that could defend against more numerous missile threats.\n\n- **Invest in new track-and-intercept capabilities**. The advent of hypersonic missiles and increased numbers of cruise missile arsenals by threat actors poses new challenges to our missile defense capabilities.\n  1. Invest in cruise missile defense of the homeland.\n  2. Accelerate the program to deploy space-based sensors that can detect and track missiles flying on nonballistic trajectories.\n  3. Accelerate the Glide Phase Interceptor, which is intended to counter hypersonic weapons.\n\n",pdfPath:__webpack_require__.p+"static/media/4_department-of-defense.889a046c.pdf"},summary:function(){return(0,jsx_runtime.jsx)("p",{children:"This chapter emphasizes strengthening the Department of Defense through military expansion and tighter executive control.

After 20 years, it has not gelled into “One DHS.” Instead, its various components' different missions have outweighed its decades-long attempt to function as one department, rendering the whole disjointed rather than cohesive. Breaking up the department along its mission lines would facilitate mission focus and provide opportunities to reduce overhead and achieve more limited government. In lieu of a status quo DHS, we recommend that:\n\n- U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) be combined with Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE); U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS); the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) Office of Refugee Resettlement (ORR); and the Department of Justice (DOJ) Executive Office for Immigration Review (EOIR) and Office of Immigration Litigation (OIL) into a standalone border and immigration agency at the Cabinet level (more than 100,000 employees, making it the third largest department measured by manpower).\n- The Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) be moved to the Department of Transportation.\n- The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) be moved to the Department of the Interior or, if combined with CISA, to the Department of Transportation.\n- The U.S. Coast Guard (USCG) be moved to DOJ and, in time of full-scale war (i.e., threatening the homeland), to the Department of Defense (DOD). Alternatively, USCG should be moved to DOD for all purposes.\n- The U.S. Secret Service (USSS) be divided in two, with the protective element moved to DOJ and the financial enforcement element moved to the Department of the Treasury.\n- The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) be privatized.\n- The Science and Technology Directorate (S&T) be moved to DOD and the Office of Countering Weapons of Mass Destruction be moved to the FBI.\n\nAll of the remaining supporting components could be dismantled because their functions already exist in the moving components as well as the receiving departments. Cutting these costs would save the American taxpayers significant sums.\n\nUnless and until this dismantling recommendation is pursued and achieved, however, DHS will statutorily continue to exist, and it needs many reforms. Accordingly, we now turn to recommended changes in DHS as it exists now.\n\n## MISSION STATEMENT\n\nThe Department of Homeland Security protects the American homeland from and prepares for terrorism and other hazards in both the physical and cyber realms, provides for secure and free movement of trade and travel, and enforces U.S. immigration laws impartially.\n\n## OVERVIEW\n\nThe Department of Homeland Security (DHS) was created in the aftermath of the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, and subsequent mailings of anthrax spores. The Homeland Security Act of 2002, which created the department, states that DHS's primary mission is to prevent terrorist attacks within the U.S.; reduce the nation's vulnerability to terrorism; minimize the damage from and assist in the recovery from any terrorist attacks; prepare and respond to natural and manmade crises and emergencies; and monitor connections between illegal drug trafficking and terrorism, coordinate efforts to sever such connections, and interdict illegal drug trafficking.\n\nUnfortunately for our nation, the federal government's newest department became like every other federal agency: bloated, bureaucratic, and expensive. It also lost sight of its mission priorities. DHS has also suffered from the Left's wokeness and weaponization against Americans whom the Left perceives as its political opponents.\n\nTo truly secure the homeland, a conservative Administration needs to return the department to the right mission, the right size, and the right budget. This would include reorganizing the department and shifting significant resources away from several supporting components to the essential operational components. Prioritizing border security and immigration enforcement, including detention and deportation, is critical if we are to regain control of the border, repair the historic damage done by the Biden Administration, return to a lawful and orderly immigration system, and protect the homeland from terrorism and public safety threats. This also includes consolidating the pieces of the fragmented immigration system into one agency to fulfill the mission more efficiently.\n\nThe Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) is a DHS component that the Left has weaponized to censor speech and affect elections at the expense of securing the cyber domain and critical infrastructure, which are threatened daily. A conservative Administration should return CISA to its statutory and important but narrow mission.\n\nThe bloated DHS bureaucracy and budget, along with the wrong priorities, provide real opportunities for a conservative Administration to cut billions in spending and limit government's role in Americans' lives. These opportunities include privatizing TSA screening and the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) National Flood Insurance Program, reforming FEMA emergency spending to shift the majority of preparedness and response costs to states and localities instead of the federal government, eliminating most of DHS's grant programs, and removing all unions in the department for national security purposes.\n\nA successful DHS would:\n- Secure and control the border;\n- Thoroughly enforce immigration laws;\n- Correctly and efficiently adjudicate immigration benefit applications while rejecting fraudulent claims;\n- Secure the cyber domain and collaborate with critical infrastructure sectors to maintain their security;\n- Provide states and localities with a limited federal emergency response and preparedness;\n- Secure our coasts and economic zones;\n- Protect political leaders, their families, and visiting heads of state or government; and\n- Oversee transportation security.\n\n## OFFICE OF THE SECRETARY (SEC)\n\nIn the next Administration, the Office of the Secretary should take on the following key issues and challenges to ensure the effective operation of DHS.\n\n### Expansion of Dedicated Political Personnel\nThe Secretary of Homeland Security is a presidentially appointed and Senate-confirmed political appointee, but for budgetary reasons, he or she has historically been unable to fund a dedicated team of political appointees. A key first step for the Secretary to improve front-office functions is to have his or her own dedicated team of political appointees selected and vetted by the Office of Presidential Personnel, which is not reliant on detailees from other parts of the department, to help ensure the completion of the next President's agenda.\n\n### An Aggressive Approach to Senate-Confirmed Leadership Positions\nWhile Senate confirmation is a constitutionally necessary requirement for appointing agency leadership, the next Administration may need to take a novel approach to the confirmations process to ensure an adequate and rapid transition. For example, the next Administration arguably should place its nominees for key positions into similar positions as “actings” (for example, putting in a person to serve as the Senior Official Performing the Duties of the Commissioner of CBP while that person is going through the confirmation process to direct ICE or become the Secretary). This approach would both guarantee implementation of the Day One agenda and equip the department for potential emergency situations while still honoring the confirmation requirement. The department should also look to remove lower-level but nevertheless important positions that currently require Senate confirmation from the confirmation requirement, although this effort would require legislation (and might also be mooted in the event of legislation that closes portions of the department that currently have Senate-confirmed leadership).\n\n### Clearer, More Durable, and Political-Only Line of Succession\nBased on previous experience, the department needs legislation to establish a more durable but politically oriented line of succession for agency decision-making purposes. The ideal sequence for line of succession is certainly debatable, except that in circumstances where a career employee holds a leadership position in the department, that position should be deemed vacant for line-of-succession purposes and the next eligible political appointee in the sequence should assume acting authority. Further, individuals wielding acting Secretary authority should have explicit authority to finalize agency actions, including regulations, to ensure that the department's homeland security mission is fulfilled.\n\n### Soft Closure of Unnecessary Offices\nPending a possible presidential decision to shrink or eliminate DHS itself, the next Administration will still have the obligation to protect the homeland as required by law. The Secretary therefore can and should use his or her inherent, discretionary leadership authority to “soft close” ineffective and problematic corners of the department. While those corners are to be determined, the Secretary could shift personnel, funding, and operational responsibility to mission-essential components of the department, including the Office of the Secretary itself. This effort not only would make the department more efficient, but also would support a legislative move to shrink or dismantle the department by showing that the agency can fulfill national security–critical functions without its current bloated bureaucracy.\n\n### Restructuring and Redistribution of Career Personnel\nTo strengthen political decision-making and ensure that taxpayer dollars are being used legally and efficiently, the Secretary should make major changes in the distribution of career personnel throughout the department. For example, personnel from parts of the department undergoing soft closure could be redistributed to what will be workload-intensive corners of the department, including national security–critical and transparency functions. All personnel with law enforcement capacity should be removed immediately from office billets and deployed to field billets to maximize law enforcement capacity.\n\n### Compliance for Grants and Other Federal Funding\nThe next Administration should take steps to restore lawfulness and integrity to the department's massive regimen of federal grant programs, most of which are managed and distributed by the Federal Emergency Management Agency. The Secretary should direct FEMA to ensure that all FEMA-issued grant funding for states, localities, and private organizations is going to recipients who are lawful actors, can demonstrate that they are in compliance with federal law, and can show that their mission and actions support the broader homeland security mission. All applicants and potential recipients of such grant funding should be required to meet certain preconditions for eligibility (except for receipt of post-disaster or nonhumanitarian funding) or should simply be considered ineligible for funding. Such preconditions should include at least the following:\n\n- Certification by applicants that they comply with all aspects of federal immigration laws, including the honoring of all immigration detainers.\n- Certification by applicants that they are both registered with E-Verify and using E-Verify in a transparent and nonevasive manner. For states and localities, that would include certification that all components of that government, and not just the applicant agency, are registered with and use E-Verify.\n- If the applicant is a state or locality, commitment by that state or locality to total information-sharing in the context of both federal law enforcement and immigration enforcement. This would include access to department of motor vehicles and voter registration databases.\n\n### Non-Use of Discretionary Guest Worker Visa Authorities\nTo stop facilitating the availability of cheap foreign labor in order to support American workers (particularly poor and middle-class American workers) and follow congressional intent, the Secretary should explicitly cease using at least two discretionary authorities as part of his or her broader effort to support American workers.\n\n- The Secretary should make it clear that he or she will not use the Secretary's existing discretionary authority to increase the number of H-2B (seasonal non-agricultural) visas above the statutorily set cap.\n- The Secretary should not issue any regulations in support of the “H-2 eligible” country list, the effect of which would prevent favoring certain foreign nationals seeking an H-2 guest worker visa based simply on their nationality.\n\n### Restoration of Honesty and Transparency\nThe Secretary should use his or her inherent authority as leader of the department to follow up with congressional and other partners to disclose information and provide the transparency that has been obstructed during the Biden Administration. The Secretary should proceed from the assumption that congressional inquiries and public information requests were unfulfilled and then seek to fulfill them.\n\n### Replacement of the Entire Homeland Security Advisory Committee\nThe Secretary should plan to quickly remove all current members of the Homeland Security Advisory Committee and replace them as quickly as is feasible.\n\n## U.S. CUSTOMS AND BORDER PROTECTION (CBP)\n\nIf all immigration agencies are not merged, including USCIS and ORR, then an appropriate third alternative would be to consolidate ICE and CBP to form a combined Border Security and Immigration Agency (BSIA). This would integrate critical interdiction, enforcement, and investigative resources, enhancing coordination and refocusing collective efforts on the vast and complex cross-border threats impacting our nation's health, safety, and national security. It would also simultaneously add efficiencies to our nation's capacity to facilitate lawful trade and travel.\n\nThe BSIA should establish clear mission requirements, responsibilities, and mandates under existing law regarding the persistent need for and utilization of U.S. military personnel and resources to assist BSIA with increasing whole-of-government efforts and long-term strategy to secure our nation's borders effectively. In addition, appropriate elements within the newly created BSIA should be designated as part of the U.S. National Security and Intelligence Community.\n\nA conservative Administration should eliminate any prohibitive guidance, direction, or mandate from DHS or the Administration that curtails or limits CBP from publishing detailed border security and enforcement data not impacting intelligence, interdiction, and investigative operations, methods, or sources. DHS should issue a regulation mandating that CBP publish accurate and timely border security data, readily available to the public, on a regular basis that avoids White House and DHS leadership review and approval.\n\nThe White House should grant the authority for CBP and DHS executives to utilize component aviation assets under the Office of Air and Marine (OAM). CBP and DHS have worldwide missions with personnel and facilities that are deployed across the globe and in every state in the U.S. With a CBP workforce alone of more than 60,000 people (240,000-plus for DHS) encompassing more than a thousand sea, land, and airports, it is essential that the Commissioner, Deputy Commissioner, Secretary, and Deputy Secretary can travel efficiently to facilities to maintain appropriate situational awareness across the department's vast mission set and interact with the expansive workforce. Although CBP operates one of the largest aviation components of any domestic U.S. law enforcement agency, executives are prohibited from utilizing the agency's aviation assets to facilitate official travel. Executives are required to fly on commercial airlines, and this requirement significantly limits their ability to have classified communications and takes them offline for extended periods of time.\n\nBorder Patrol (BP) and OAM should be combined within CBP. BP has more than 20,000 personnel, and OAM has approximately 1,800. OAM's assets are dedicated in support of BP operations the vast majority of the time, yet redundant approvals, strategies, and independent hierarchal commands serve as impediments to efficient and practical resource deployments.\n\nCBP should restart and expand use of the horseback-mounted Border Patrol. As part of this announcement, the Secretary should clear the records and personnel files of those who were falsely accused by Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas of whipping migrants and issue a formal apology on behalf of DHS and CBP.\n\nThe Secretary should combine the Office of Trade (OT) and Trade Relations with the Office of Field Operations (OFO). The OT is the smallest of CBP's components, and its operational counterpart, OFO, has a workforce of more than 30,000. OT's function is interwoven with that of its OFO operational counterpart. Combining OT with OFO would achieve streamlined operations and increase OT's capacity and capability by leveraging OFO's expansive resources.\n\nCBP, ICE, and USCIS all have authority to issue Notices to Appear (NTA) to removable aliens in their presence, which begins removal proceedings. In most instances, CBP should turn illegal aliens over to ICE for detention, and ICE can then issue any needed NTA. CBP should issue NTAs only in limited situations for humanitarian reasons, such as medical emergencies. In addition, CBP should eliminate use of Notices to Report (NTR) altogether.\n\nCBP's established national standards of Transport, Escort, Detention, and Search (TEDS) have been widely interpreted and expanded by lower courts. This has resulted in unrealistic and differing detention standards for CBP facilities based on the jurisdiction within which they fall, negatively impacting operations. ICE has suffered similarly. A single nationwide detention standard should be codified that prevents individual states from mandating that federal government agencies adhere to widely expansive and ever-changing sets of standards. Such standards should allow the flexibility to use large numbers of temporary facilities such as tents.\n\nThe annual costs associated with establishing and maintaining temporary facilities to address the flow of illegal migration and associated care, transportation, and processing are prohibitive, and CBP's budget is inadequate. CBP is forced to forgo critical mission-essential endeavors to fund the additional associated costs. Often, this requires the reprogramming of funding at the DHS level, which has a negative impact on other DHS components' operations. This predictable cost that has to be paid from existing CBP and DHS funding levels reduces CBP's operational readiness and ability to accomplish its diverse and critical missions to protect the American people. The next President should request a realistic budget that fully pays for these costs.\n\nIncreased funding is needed for BP to hire additional support personnel, which would relieve uniformed BP agents from administrative duties associated with processing aliens and allow them to return to their national security mission. Congress should increase funding for facility upgrades at strategic land Ports of Entry (POEs), including expanding state-of-the-art technology such as Non-Intrusive Inspection equipment. Today, the cartels exploit the aging facilities and lack of adequate technology to smuggle illicit drugs, contraband, and more successfully through our nation's POEs.\n\n## U.S. IMMIGRATION AND CUSTOMS ENFORCEMENT (ICE)\n\n### Needed Reforms\n\nSince the formation of DHS, ICE has increasingly been tasked with auxiliary missions that have little or nothing to do with either immigration or customs enforcement. To return ICE to its primary mission, any new Administration that wishes to restore the rule of law to our immigration enforcement efforts should:\n\n- **Order ICE to stop closing out pending immigration cases** and apply the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) as written by Congress. The Biden Administration closed out tens of thousands of immigration cases that had already been prepared and were slated for expedited removal processing or hearings before the U.S. Immigration Court. This misguided action constituted an egregious example of lawlessness that allowed thousands of illegal aliens and other immigration violators to go free in the United States.\n  \n- **Direct ICE to stop ignoring criminal aliens identified through the 287(g) program.** Ultimately, Congress should prevent ICE from ignoring criminal aliens identified by local law enforcement agencies that are partners in the 287(g) program. However, before congressional action, ICE should be directed to take custody of all aliens with records for felonies, crimes of violence, DUIs, previous removals, and any other crime that is considered a national security or public safety threat as defined under current laws.\n\n- **Eliminate T and U visas.** Victimization should not be a basis for an immigration benefit. If an alien who was a trafficking or crime victim is actively and significantly cooperating with law enforcement as a witness, the S visa is already available and should be used. Pending elimination of the T and U visas, the Secretary should significantly restrict eligibility for each visa to prevent fraud.\n\n- **Issue clear guidance regarding detention and bond for aliens.** Thousands of illegal aliens are allowed to bond out of immigration detention only to disappear into the interior of the United States where many commit crimes and many others disappear, never to be heard from again. This occurs primarily because of poorly worded bond regulations, contradictory bond policy memoranda, and poor practices for managing released aliens and the Alternatives to Detention (ATD) Program, which requires significant reform.\n\n- **Prioritize national security in the Student and Exchange Visitor Program (SEVP).** ICE should end its current cozy deference to educational institutions and remove security risks from the program. This requires working with the Department of State to eliminate or significantly reduce the number of visas issued to foreign students from enemy nations.\n\nMost of the foregoing can be accomplished rapidly and effectively through executive action that is both lawful and appropriate. Additionally, ICE should clarify who is responsible for enforcing its criminal and civil authorities. It should also remove self-imposed limitations on its nationwide jurisdiction.\n\n- **Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) Special Agents in the 1811 series** should enforce Title 8 and 18 crimes as the biggest part of their portfolio. Alien smuggling, trafficking, and cross-border crime as defined under Title 8 and Title 18 should be the focus of ICE operations.\n\n- **Clarify the role of ICE Deportation Officers.** ICE Enforcement and Removal Operations (ERO) should be identified as being primarily responsible for enforcing civil immigration regulations, including the civil arrest, detention, and removal of immigration violators anywhere in the United States, without warrant where appropriate, subject only to the civil warrant requirements of the INA where appropriate.\n\n- **Rescind all ICE memoranda identifying “sensitive zones”** where ICE personnel are prohibited from operating. Rely on the good judgment of officers in the field to avoid inappropriate situations.\n\n- **Make full use of existing Expedited Removal (ER) authorities.** The agency has limited the use of ER to eligible aliens apprehended within 100 miles of the border. This is not a statutory requirement.\n\n### New Policies\n\nU.S. national security and public safety interests would be well-served if ICE were to be combined with CBP and USCIS, as mentioned above. Additionally, ICE/HSI, along with CBP, should be full participants in the Intelligence Community.\n\n- **Operationalize the use of Blackie's Warrants within ICE.** These civil search warrants are commonly used for worksite enforcement when agents have probable cause that illegal aliens are employed at a business. This would streamline investigations.\n\n- **Ensure continuous vetting and investigations of many aliens who exploited President Biden's open border** for potentially nefarious purposes, including some Afghan evacuees sent directly to the U.S. during America's disastrous withdrawal from Afghanistan.\n\n### Budget\n\n- **Mandate and fund additional bed space for alien detainees.** Congress should increase ICE's detention space to allow for 100,000 available beds daily.\n\n- **Fund additional personnel.** Congress should support ICE by increasing the budget for at least 20,000 ERO officers and 5,000 Office of the Principal Legal Advisor (OPLA) attorneys.\n\n## U.S. CITIZENSHIP AND IMMIGRATION SERVICES (USCIS)\n\nUSCIS is tasked with administering legal immigration and certain temporary visa programs.\n\n### Needed Reforms\n\nSince January 2021, USCIS has transformed into an open-borders agency, ignoring its critical role in national security and public safety. To return USCIS to its primary function as a screening and vetting agency, a conservative Administration should:\n\n- **Refocus on screening and vetting.** Regulatory efforts have focused on easing asylum eligibility in a manner that exacerbates fraud. Misaligned priorities have placed emphasis on expanding parole and temporary status programs that violate the law and congressional intent.\n\n- **Reform the Fraud Detection and National Security Directorate (FDNS).** FDNS should undergo a structural shift focused on direct reporting from the field to headquarters, reclassification of leadership, and prioritization of vetting and fraud detection over other agency directives.\n\n- **Reestablish the denaturalization unit** within USCIS, in cooperation with the Department of Justice, to pursue denaturalization cases involving aliens who obtained citizenship through fraud.\n\n- **Create a criminal enforcement component within USCIS** to investigate immigration benefits fraud under Title 8 and prosecute cases via Special Assistant U.S. Attorneys with expertise in this area.\n\n- **Audit and rescind** all Biden Administration policies, memoranda, and management directives to revert USCIS to its original mission.\n\n### New Policies\n\nTo address broader immigration issues, the core immigration agencies—USCIS, ICE, and CBP—should merge, including the Office of Refugee Resettlement (ORR) from HHS, to form a single, cohesive entity. Short of this merger, USCIS should:\n\n- **Realign workforce training on base eligibility and fraud detection.**\n\n- **Resume adjudicator training at the Federal Law Enforcement Training Centers (FLETC)** to emphasize the enforcement and vetting role of USCIS.\n\n- **Adopt a conservative regulatory agenda.** USCIS should pursue rulemaking for the Trump Administration's public charge rule, employment authorization reform, asylum reform, and U visa reform.\n\n- **Shift away from internal policy mechanisms that allow lenient adjudication standards.** USCIS should also rescind COVID-era procedural flexibilities, such as biometrics reuse.\n\n### Budget\n\nUSCIS is primarily funded through application fees paid by those seeking immigration benefits, work permits, and naturalization, with a small portion coming from congressional appropriations.\n\n- **Increase application fees to reflect inflation and true adjudication costs.** USCIS should submit a fee rule that raises fees across the board to keep up with inflation. This increase should also limit fee waivers and implement a fee for asylum applications.\n\n- **Expand premium processing options.** Offering more premium processing options would allow applicants to expedite their processing times, which could generate a significant influx of revenue for USCIS.\n\n- **Implement strict financial penalties for rejected applicants.** Until USCIS clears its backlog, applicants rejected for any benefit should be required to leave the United States immediately, and USCIS should pause intake of applications in backlogged categories.\n\n### Personnel\n\nUSCIS should be classified as a national security–sensitive agency, with all employees in national security–sensitive roles.\n\n- **Investigate and discipline leaks as in a national security agency.** USCIS should remove personnel who cannot adhere to security standards and, if necessary, decertify the USCIS employee union.\n\n- **Decentralize personnel out of Washington, D.C., and reassign them to field offices.** Rotating USCIS staff into communities most impacted by immigration decisions would improve agency accountability and connect staff directly to affected communities.\n\n## NECESSARY BORDER AND IMMIGRATION STATUTORY, REGULATORY, AND ADMINISTRATIVE CHANGES\n\nTo address current border security challenges, Congress must pass legislation to close existing loopholes and ensure the continuity of U.S. immigration control.\n\n### Legislative Proposals\n\n- **Create a Title 8-based public health authority** akin to Title 42 for immediate expulsion of illegal border crossers under specific non-health conditions.\n\n- **Mandate appropriations for border wall system infrastructure** in accordance with the Border Security Improvement Plan (BSIP) for strategic locations.\n\n- **Repeal or amend the William Wilberforce Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act of 2008** to allow the expedited return of unaccompanied minors to their home countries.\n\n- **End the Flores Settlement Agreement** by establishing nationwide standards for family and unaccompanied minor detention, allowing for the use of temporary facilities where needed.\n\n- **Reform asylum eligibility requirements.** Raise the credible fear standard to align with the asylum standard and codify asylum bars for gang and domestic violence cases as grounds for ineligibility.\n\n- **End abuse of parole authority.** Congress should clarify and limit the use of parole to extraordinary and limited purposes, aligning it with the original statutory intent.\n\n- **Eliminate funding for NGOs involved in processing or transporting illegal aliens.** Instead, redirect these funds to support border security, detention facilities, and spaces for immigration court proceedings.\n\n- **Expand Migrant Protection Protocols** (Remain in Mexico) and **Asylum Cooperative Agreements** to ensure that asylum seekers can be processed outside of the U.S., where feasible.\n\n- **Limit employment authorization** to legal immigrants and certain non-immigrants by enacting stricter controls over work permits. Also, **mandate E-Verify** to ensure employment eligibility verification.\n\n- **Empower state and local law enforcement** to participate in immigration enforcement consistent with Arizona v. United States. Congress should also require compliance with federal immigration detainers and establish financial disincentives for sanctuary policies.\n\n- **Mandate detention of illegal border crossers** by clarifying that Title 8 requires detention, not discretionary release, ensuring stronger enforcement of immigration laws.\n\n### Regulatory Changes\n\n- **Withdraw Biden Administration regulations** on credible fear and asylum jurisdiction for border crossers and public charge standards, replacing them with rules that prioritize national security and prevent fraud.\n\n- **Reform T and U visa eligibility requirements** to ensure these visas are granted only to legitimate trafficking and crime victims who provide substantial assistance to law enforcement.\n\n- **Eliminate Temporary Protected Status (TPS) designations** and transition to a stricter employment-based immigration system.\n\n- **Revamp the H-1B program** to prioritize high-skilled workers at competitive wages, minimizing any displacement of U.S. workers.\n\n### Executive Orders\n\n- **Restore the Asylum Cooperative Agreements and Remain in Mexico Protocols** by directing the Department of State and DHS to renegotiate and reimplement these policies immediately.\n\n- **Restrict the use of Notices to Report and government-sponsored transportation** for illegal aliens, instead mandating detention or supervised processing.\n\n- **Curtail discretionary parole** and limit its use to cases certified by DHS as meeting strict humanitarian or public benefit criteria.\n\n- **Mandate E-Verify use for federal contractors** and employees working with government agencies to ensure employment eligibility verification.\n\n- **Ensure comprehensive access to national security databases** for USCIS by designating it as Intelligence Community-adjacent, facilitating better information-sharing for immigration-related national security screening.\n\n### Subregulatory Measures\n\n- **Prioritize fraud detection and eligibility verification** by realigning USCIS Fraud Detection and National Security (FDNS) operations and increasing transparency.\n\n- **Reinstate ICE worksite enforcement initiatives** using Blackie's Warrants to address employment of illegal aliens in industries susceptible to exploitation.\n\n- **Mandate cooperation for 287(g) program participants** and refocus Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) on immigration-related criminal activities.\n\n### FEDERAL EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT AGENCY (FEMA)\n\n#### Needed Reforms\n\nFEMA's expanded role has led it to compensate for gaps in state and local preparedness, often at great cost. Reform should prioritize true federalism by reducing FEMA's burden and redirecting resources to genuinely catastrophic disasters. Key reforms include:\n\n- **Adjust the per capita indicator for damages** under the Stafford Act, making it inflation-adjusted to ensure states and localities contribute to their own recovery costs, reserving FEMA's resources for major events.\n\n- **Implement a deductible system** that would require states to meet certain cost thresholds before becoming eligible for FEMA assistance. This would encourage state-level preparedness and responsible budgeting for disaster resilience.\n\n- **Reform cost-sharing ratios** so that the federal government only covers a higher percentage for the most catastrophic events, shifting more responsibility to states for smaller-scale disasters.\n\n- **Wind down the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP).** FEMA should begin phasing out NFIP in favor of a privately managed system, starting with low-risk areas. This would reduce reliance on federal subsidies and encourage private sector risk management in flood-prone zones.\n\n#### Budget Considerations\n\nFEMA's grant programs, originally intended to bolster state and local preparedness, have often devolved into pork-barrel spending that does not measurably enhance national resilience. To refocus these funds:\n\n- **Eliminate or significantly reduce non-disaster grant programs** that lack clear ties to genuine preparedness improvements. Redirect funds to support disaster response, relief, and infrastructure resilience.\n\n- **Decrease FEMA's reliance on debt financing** by promoting state preparedness, budget restructuring, and realigning funding priorities.\n\n#### Personnel and Structure\n\n- **Reduce Senate-confirmed positions** to streamline FEMA's leadership, retaining only the Administrator as a confirmed role to allow rapid response and decision-making.\n\n- **Reposition FEMA's \"springing Cabinet position.\"** This change would prevent operational disruptions by reducing turnover and ensuring steady leadership during crises.\n\n### CYBERSECURITY AND INFRASTRUCTURE SECURITY AGENCY (CISA)\n\n#### Needed Reforms\n\nCISA's role has expanded beyond its core missions of protecting federal networks and coordinating critical infrastructure security. To realign CISA with its statutory mandate:\n\n- **End all counter-disinformation programs.** CISA should cease involvement in content moderation or censorship activities, which fall outside its original mission scope.\n\n- **Narrow CISA's mission** to focus solely on federal network security (.gov) and critical infrastructure resilience. Transfer emergency communications and Chemical Facility Anti-Terrorism Standards (CFATS) to FEMA.\n\n- **Limit election security responsibilities** to cyber hygiene assistance for states and localities, avoiding involvement in messaging or influencing election processes.\n\n- **Disband the CISA Cybersecurity Advisory Committee** and refocus CISA's resources on direct cyber threat mitigation and infrastructure protection.\n\n### U.S. COAST GUARD (USCG)\n\n#### Mission and Budget Realignment\n\nUSCG should concentrate on defending U.S. waters and economic zones, while supporting the Navy in wartime as needed:\n\n- **Scale down USCG's mission to focus on U.S. home waters.** Allocate resources to patrol the Pacific to counter growing foreign fishing and security threats, especially from China, while maintaining anti-smuggling operations in the Caribbean.\n\n- **Update fleet acquisition plans.** Submit a long-term shipbuilding plan to Congress that aligns with U.S. strategic goals and budget realities. Coordinate with the Navy on shipyard utilization to ensure timely and budget-conscious fleet development.\n\n- **Prioritize Arctic responsibilities based on funding.** USCG should only maintain Arctic operations if funding levels support it; otherwise, consider transferring Arctic duties to the Navy.\n\n#### Personnel Considerations\n\n- **Revise recruitment and retention messaging** to attract a high-caliber workforce. Emphasize mission-critical skills rather than politically charged narratives.\n\n- **Reinstate personnel who left over COVID-19 vaccine requirements,** with credited time in service. Review promotions and hirings under the previous administration to ensure merit-based advancement.\n\n### U.S. SECRET SERVICE (USSS)\n\n#### Needed Reforms\n\nUSSS must focus exclusively on its protective mission, shedding non-essential investigative duties to bolster its core functions:\n\n- **Separate investigative and protective missions.** Transfer financial crime investigations to the Departments of Justice and Treasury, allowing USSS to concentrate solely on physical protection.\n\n- **Close or transfer non-Washington, D.C., field offices.** Agents stationed outside of Washington, D.C., should be reassigned to Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) offices for assistance with local protection duties.\n\n- **Retain only immigration-related financial investigations.** USSS may investigate crimes tied to illegal immigration financing, such as remittances, payments to smugglers, and other illegal financial activities.\n\n- **Implement a visitor log policy for all presidential facilities.** This would improve transparency and accountability, especially for frequent trips outside the White House.\n\n#### Budget and Personnel Adjustments\n\n- **Reallocate budget savings from office closures to protection initiatives.** With fewer offices, funds can be directed towards enhancing protective training, resources, and recruitment.\n\n- **Enhance Uniformed Division staffing and responsibilities.** Increase personnel to manage high turnover and assign full law enforcement powers within Washington, D.C., broadening their jurisdiction for experience and morale.\n\n### TRANSPORTATION SECURITY ADMINISTRATION (TSA)\n\n#### Pathway to Privatization\n\nThe current TSA model is inefficient and should be replaced with a privatized model, emulating European and Canadian security operations:\n\n- **Expand the Screening Partnership Program (SPP)** to enable airports to manage security operations through private contractors, with TSA setting standards and overseeing compliance.\n\n- **Adopt a Canadian model** by creating a government corporation to contract private screening services, with regional bidding to drive down costs.\n\n- **Deunionize TSA's workforce** to streamline operations, enhance security flexibility, and improve morale.\n\n#### Potential Cost Savings and Benefits\n\n- **Achieve a 15–20% cost reduction** compared to current TSA operating budgets. Privatization could lead to more responsive, traveler-oriented service, coupled with lower taxpayer costs.\n\n### MANAGEMENT DIRECTORATE (MGMT)\n\n#### Streamlining Operations and Reducing Bureaucracy\n\nThe Management Directorate should undergo extensive reforms to eliminate redundancy and improve efficiency:\n\n- **Assign a small advisory team** in the Front Office (FO) with expertise in operational management, U.S. government employment law, and restructuring to guide and assess necessary structural changes.\n\n- **Revise senior leadership reporting structures.** The Senior Executive Service (SES) should revert to their original role as managers adaptable to any subject matter, ensuring skilled management at every level.\n\n- **Analyze and revise Management Directives** to remove red tape in hiring, IT, procurement, and budgeting. Specifically, streamline the Office of the Chief Human Capital Officer's hiring process and reduce procurement bottlenecks for innovative technology.\n\n#### Financial Oversight and Legislative Affairs\n\n- **Integrate appropriations staff with Legislative Affairs (OLA)** for unified, consistent messaging and accountability to Congress, avoiding discrepancies and \"answer shopping\" by congressional staff.\n\n- **Centralize budget communications to avoid inconsistencies.** The Chief Financial Officer (CFO) should coordinate with OLA before submitting budgetary responses to Congress.\n\n- **Reposition the Federal Protective Service (FPS)** under direct Secretary oversight, especially in times of civil unrest, to ensure law enforcement expertise and authority during crises.\n\n---\n\n### OFFICE OF STRATEGY, POLICY, AND PLANS (PLCY)\n\n#### Key Department-Level Reforms\n\nThe Office of Strategy, Policy, and Plans should lead the charge in aligning the Department of Homeland Security's (DHS) priorities with presidential objectives while respecting Americans' rights:\n\n- **Inventory and re-evaluate domestic terrorism initiatives** to ensure consistency with the administration's goals and constitutional rights.\n\n- **Publish and analyze DHS's past activities related to social media censorship** and disengage any personnel involved in such efforts. Transparency will restore trust and focus on mission-oriented tasks.\n\n- **Centralize the DHS grant policy.** All granting decisions across components should follow department-wide guidelines, vetted for alignment with the President's priorities, to ensure consistency and effective use of funds.\n\n#### Streamlining and Reducing Bureaucracy\n\n- **Consolidate redundant reporting requirements.** PLCY should work with Congress to reduce overlapping and outdated reporting obligations. Consider eliminating the Quadrennial Homeland Security Review for improved focus on mission-critical tasks.\n\n#### Enhancing Immigration Data and Transparency\n\n- **Develop a centralized Immigration Statistics program** to produce timely, reliable data across all immigration-related components, enabling DHS to better monitor and inform on immigration trends.\n\n### OFFICE OF INTELLIGENCE AND ANALYSIS (I&A)\n\n#### Proposal for Elimination\n\nThe Office of Intelligence and Analysis should be dismantled, as it has proven both ineffective and politicized. DHS components and the Intelligence Community (IC) already supply raw intelligence, making I&A redundant.\n\n- **Shift remaining essential functions to the National Operations Center (NOC)** within the Office of Operations Coordination (OPS). This would ensure that classified situational awareness and operational information flow efficiently across DHS without duplicative analysis.\n\n- **Rely on partnerships with established intelligence agencies,** such as the NSA and FBI, for cyber and critical infrastructure intelligence, streamlining and strengthening coordination efforts.\n\n### OFFICE OF THE GENERAL COUNSEL (OGC)\n\n#### Needed Reforms\n\nThe Office of General Counsel (OGC) should prioritize advising DHS leadership on ways to legally execute policies rather than focusing on potential obstacles.\n\n- **Realign reporting structures.** Each component's chief counsel should report directly to their component head and indirectly to the DHS General Counsel to ensure that specific mission-related issues receive the most relevant legal guidance. This structure also maintains consistency in advice across DHS.\n\n- **Increase political oversight of legal decisions.** More Schedule C/political appointees should be hired within OGC to supervise career staff and ensure that legal positions align with the administration's objectives, maintaining a consistent response to congressional oversight, Inspector General inquiries, and FOIA requests.\n\n- **Invest in advanced e-discovery software** and a dedicated vendor for e-discovery management to streamline litigation responses and meet congressional oversight requests efficiently.\n\n- **Revise document-gathering protocols** for congressional inquiries, allowing a designated office like the Chief Information Officer to collect necessary documentation promptly, thereby eliminating delays and minimizing negative press.\n\n### OFFICE OF LEGISLATIVE AFFAIRS (OLA); OFFICE OF PUBLIC AFFAIRS (OPA); AND OFFICE OF PARTNERSHIP AND ENGAGEMENT (OPE)\n\n#### Consolidation and Mission Alignment\n\nDHS's external communications functions should be restructured to enhance effectiveness:\n\n- **Merge the Office of Partnership and Engagement into the Office of Public Affairs.** This consolidation would streamline external engagement and allow DHS to operate with a more cohesive communication strategy.\n\n- **Standardize component reporting** for public and legislative affairs, requiring that these offices report directly to their respective headquarters counterparts. This alignment ensures that DHS speaks with one voice and enables the efficient reallocation of staff to address crises or high-priority issues.\n\n- **Limit congressional interactions to political appointees in OLA.** Appropriations and budget matters should be centralized within OLA to prevent \"answer shopping\" by congressional staff and ensure consistent communication.\n\n- **Reassess congressional reporting requirements.** DHS should work with Congress to eliminate redundant or outdated reporting obligations, setting expiration dates on reporting mandates to keep requirements relevant and effective.\n\n- **Shift focus toward representing the President and the Secretary's agendas,** rather than being a complaint resolution office for Congress or other external entities.\n\n### OFFICE OF OPERATIONS COORDINATION (OPS)\n\nOPS should serve as a tactical operations and coordination hub within DHS:\n\n- **Absorb essential tactical intelligence functions from I&A,** placing these roles within the National Operations Center. Intelligence officers should support real-time operations without engaging in strategic analysis, focusing instead on direct operational needs.\n\n- **Establish rotating billets for major DHS components** within OPS to ensure ongoing collaboration and situational awareness across DHS.\n\n### OFFICE FOR CIVIL RIGHTS AND CIVIL LIBERTIES (CRCL) AND PRIVACY OFFICE (PRIV)\n\n#### Streamlining and Refocusing on Core Responsibilities\n\nThe original mandate of CRCL was limited, and its scope has since grown beyond its statutory intent:\n\n- **Restructure CRCL and PRIV under the Office of General Counsel.** With a narrower scope, CRCL should focus on equal employment opportunity and civil rights matters specific to DHS headquarters and support functions.\n\n- **Transfer operational components' civil liberties investigations** to each component's designated officers, allowing CRCL to concentrate on policy oversight.\n\n- **Limit PRIV's privacy protections to U.S. persons and Lawful Permanent Residents.** This aligns with the Privacy Act and ensures that privacy resources are focused on compliance rather than expanding to areas beyond statutory requirements.\n\n- **Eliminate outside advisory boards and working groups,** limiting external engagement to the Deputy General Counsel to maintain consistent messaging and policy alignment.\n\n### OFFICE OF THE IMMIGRATION DETENTION OMBUDSMAN (OIDO) AND OFFICE OF THE CITIZENSHIP AND IMMIGRATION SERVICES OMBUDSMAN (CISOMB)\n\n#### Recommendations for Elimination\n\n- **Eliminate the Office of the Immigration Detention Ombudsman (OIDO).** Oversight of detention facilities should be streamlined by consolidating responsibilities within existing ICE and CBP complaint mechanisms, reducing redundancies and bureaucratic burdens.\n\n- **Absorb CISOMB's functions into USCIS.** Specialized casework can be managed within USCIS itself, similar to the IRS's Taxpayer Advocate model, while policy oversight can shift to the Office of Inspector General (OIG) and Government Accountability Office (GAO).\n\n#### Alternative Measures if Offices Remain\n\n- **Restrict OIDO to a single immigration oversight role.** Should OIDO persist, CRCL's overlapping immigration oversight duties should be shifted to OIDO to reduce duplication.\n\n- **Prevent CISOMB from aiding illegal aliens.** The focus of the ombudsman should remain on providing fair service to lawful applicants rather than supporting individuals without legal status.\n\n### AGENCY RELATIONSHIPS\n\nDHS's success in implementing immigration policy and border security initiatives requires coordinated relationships across several agencies:\n\n- **Department of Health and Human Services (HHS):** Transfer the Office of Refugee Resettlement (ORR) to DHS to streamline immigration functions, or secure HHS's full support for DHS-led immigration goals.\n\n- **Department of Defense (DOD):** Assist in the construction of border infrastructure and deploy resources to support border security efforts, ensuring comprehensive border management.\n\n- **Department of Justice (DOJ):** Transfer immigration-related offices, such as the Executive Office for Immigration Review and Office of Immigration Litigation, to DHS. Ensure immigration judges are classified as national security personnel, with non-union status and additional hiring resources.\n\n- **Department of State (DOS):** Empower DHS to lead Western Hemisphere security and migration efforts, imposing sanctions on countries that fail to accept deportees.\n\n- **Department of Labor (DOL):** Adjust policies to prevent the undercutting of American wages, including eliminating the lowest wage levels in temporary work visa programs.\n\n- **Intelligence Community (IC):** Phase out I&A's IC status, replacing it with CBP and HSI's intelligence operations, aligning immigration and national security resources more effectively.\n\n#### Author's Note\n\nThis chapter reflects contributions from experts within DHS, synthesizing their recommendations to strengthen DHS policy and operations.
